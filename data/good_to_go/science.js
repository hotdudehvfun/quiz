    answer: `Answer: B`,
    exp: `Answer: B
Explanation: A vertical section through different layers of the soil
is called the soil profile. Each layer differs in feel (texture), colour,
depth and chemical composition. These layers are referred to as
horizons.
The uppermost horizon is generally dark in colour as it is rich in
humus and minerals. The humus makes the soil fertile and provides
nutrients to growing plants. This layer is generally soft, porous and
can retain more water. It is called the topsoil or the A-horizon. This
provides shelter for many living organisms such as worms, rodents,
moles and beetles. The roots of small plants are embedded entirely
in the topsoil.
The next layer has a lesser amount of humus but more of minerals.
This layer is generally harder and more compact and is called the Bhorizon or the middle layer.
The third layer is the C-horizon, which is made up of small lumps of
rocks with cracks and crevices. Below this layer is the bedrock,
which is hard and difficult to dig with a spade.

Explanation: The best topsoil for growing plants is loam. Loamy soil
is a mixture of sand, clay and another type of soil particle known as
silt. Silt occurs as a deposit in river beds. The size of the silt
particles is between those of sand and clay.
The loamy soil also has humus in it. It has the right water holding
capacity for the growth of plants.
Clayey soil and loamy soil are suitable for growing wheat, gram and
paddy, as they have good amount of humus in them; while cotton is
grown in sandy soil and loamy soil, which facilitate quick draining of
water.

    answer: `Answer: B`,
    exp: `Answer: B
Explanation: During heavy exercise, fast running , cycling, walking
for many hours or heavy weight lifting, the demand for energy is
high. But the supply of oxygen to produce the energy is limited. Then
anaerobic respiration takes places in the muscle cells to fulfil the
demand of energy. The partial breakdown of glucose produces lactic
acid. The accumulation of lactic acid causes muscle cramps. We can
get relief from cramps after a hot water bath or a massage. Hot
water bath or massage improves circulation of blood. As a result, the
supply of oxygen to the muscle cells increases. The increase in the
supply of oxygen results in the complete breakdown of lactic acid
into carbon dioxide and water.

lungs to the cells of the body.
4. There are two types of blood vessels present in the body -
arteries and veins. Arteries carry oxygen-rich blood from the heart
to all parts of the body. Since the blood flow is rapid and at a high
pressure, the arteries have thick elastic walls.
5. Veins are the vessels which carry carbon dioxide-rich blood from
all parts of the body back to the heart. The veins have thin walls.
There are valves present in veins which allow blood to flow only
towards the heart.
6. The heart is an organ which beats continuously to act as a pump

    answer: `Answer: B`,
    exp: `Answer: B
Explanation: The inner lining of the stomach secretes mucus,
hydrochloric acid and digestive juices. Mucus protects the lining of
the stomach. The hydrochloric acid kills many bacteria that enter
along with the food and makes the medium in the stomach acidic and
helps the digestive juices to act. Digestive juices break down the
proteins into simpler substances
The digested food can now pass into the blood vessels through the
wall of the small intestine. This process is called absorption.
The large intestine absorbs water and some salts from the
undigested food material.
The liver is the largest gland in the body. It secretes bile juice that
is stored in a sac called the gallbladder. Bile plays an important role
in the digestion of fats.`

    exp: `Answer: D
Explanation: It is the microscopic unicellular organism found in pond
water which keeps changing its shape and position constantly. It has
a cell membrane, a rounded, dense nucleus and many small bubblelike vacuoles in its cytoplasm.
The amoeba is a tiny, one-celled organism. You need a microscope to
see most amoebas - the largest are only about 1 mm across. Amoebas
live in fresh water (like puddle and ponds), in salt water, in wet soil,
and in animals (including people). There are many different types of
amoebas. The name amoeba comes from the Greek word amoibe,
which means change. (Amoeba is sometimes spelled ameba.)
1. Cell membrane - the thin layer of protein and fat that surrounds
the amoeba; it allows some substances to pass into the cell, and
blocks other substances.
2. Contractile vacuole - a cavity within the amoeba that excretes
excess water and waste; the waste is brought to the cell membrane
and is then eliminated from the amoeba.
3. Cytoplasm (ectoplasm and endoplasm) - a jelly-like material that
fills most of the cell; the organelles (like the nucleus) are
surrounded by cytoplasm.
4. Food vacuole - a cavity within the amoeba in which food is
digested (broken down in order to be absorbed by the amoeba).
5. Nucleus - the major organelle of the amoeba, located centrally; it
controls reproduction (it contains the chromosomes) and many other
important functions (including eating and growth).
6. Pseudopods - temporary “feet” that the amoeba uses to move
around and to engulf food.
An amoeba consists of a single blobby cell surrounded by a porous
cell membrane. The amoeba “breathes” using this membrane - oxygen
gas from the water passes in to the amoeba through the cell
membrane and carbon dioxide gas leaves through it. A complex, jellylike series of folded membranes called cytoplasm fills most of the
cell. A large, disk-shaped nucleus within the amoeba controls the
growth and reproduction of the amoeba.`

Explanation: The liver is an abdominal glandular organ in
the digestive system. It is located in the right upper quadrant of
the abdomen, under the diaphragm and on top of the stomach. The
liver is a vital organ that supports nearly every other organ to some
capacity. The liver is the body's second-largest organ (skin is the
largest organ.
Function: "The liver has a complex role in the function of the body,"

the University of Florida Health Shands Hospital.
"Detoxification, metabolism (including regulation of glycogen
storage), hormone regulation, protein synthesis, digestion, and
decomposition of red blood cells, to name a few."
 Production of bile, which helps carry away waste and break
down fats in the small intestine during digestion.
 Production of certain proteins for blood plasma.
 Production of cholesterol and special proteins to help carry
fats through the body
 Conversion of excess glucose into glycogen for storage
(glycogen can later be converted back to glucose for energy)
and to balance and make glucose as needed
 Regulation of blood levels of amino acids, which form the
building blocks of proteins
 Processing of hemoglobin for use of its iron content (the liver
stores iron)
 Conversion of poisonous ammonia to urea (urea is an end
product of protein metabolism and is excreted in the urine)
 Clearing the blood of drugs and other poisonous substances
 Regulating blood clotting
 Resisting infections by making immune factors and removing
bacteria from the bloodstream
 Clearance of bilirubin, also from red blood cells. If there is an
accumulation of bilirubin, the skin and eyes turn yellow.`

fungus provides shelter, water and minerals to the alga and, in
return, the alga prepares and provides food to the fungus.
The bacterium called Rhizobium can take atmospheric nitrogen and
convert it into a usable form. But Rhizobium cannot make its own
food. So, it often lives in the roots of gram, peas, moong, beans and
other legumes and provides them with nitrogen. In return, the plants
provide food and shelter to the bacteria. They, thus, have a
symbiotic relationship. (i.e., between plants and bacteria).`

Explanation: Some organisms live together and share both shelter
and nutrients. This relationship is called symbiosis. For example,
certain fungi live inside the roots of plants. The plants provide
nutrients to the fungus and, in return, the fungus provides water and
certain nutrients. For example: lichens.
The mode of nutrition in which organisms take in nutrients from
dead and decaying matter is called saprotrophic nutrition. Such
organisms with saprotrophic mode of nutrition are called
saprotrophs. For example fungi, that grow on pickles, leather,
clothes and other articles that had been left out in hot and humid
weather for a long time, is a saprotroph. Note that during the rainy

    ],
    answer: `Answer: D`,
    exp: `Answer: D
Explanation: Leaves have a green pigment called chlorophyll. It
helps leaves to capture the energy of sunlight. This energy is used
to synthesise (prepare) food from carbon dioxide and water. Since
the synthesis of food occurs in the presence of sunlight, it is called
photosynthesis (Photo: light; synthesis: to prepare). So, chlorophyll,
sunlight, carbon dioxide and water are necessary to carry out the
process of photosynthesis.
What is photosynthesis?
Photosynthesis is the process in which light energy is converted to
chemical energy in the form of sugars. In a process driven by light
energy, glucose molecules (or other sugars) are constructed from
water and carbon dioxide, and oxygen is released as a byproduct.
The glucose molecules provide organisms with two crucial resources:
energy and fixed—organic—carbon.`

Explanation: Leaves are the food factories of plants. Water and
minerals present in the soil are absorbed by the roots and
transported to the leaves. Therefore, all the raw materials must
reach the leaf.
A plant needs sunlight, carbon dioxide, minerals and water to make
food by photosynthesis. A green substance in plants called
chlorophyll traps the energy from the sun needed to make food.
Chlorophyll is mostly found in leaves, inside plastids. Which are
inside the leaf cells. The leaf can be thought as food factory. Leaves
of plants vary in shape and size, but they are always the plant organ
best suited to capture solar energy. Once the food is made in the
leaf, it is transported to the other parts of the plant such as steams
and roots.`

Consider the following statements in the context of cutting off the supply of air: \n 1. Water vapours, formed due to water being poured on the flame, surround the combustible material, helping in cutting off the supply of air. \n 2. CO2, being heavier than oxygen, covers the fire like a blanket. Since the contact between the fuel and oxygen is cut off, the fire is controlled. \n Which of the statements given above is/are correct?`,

    ],
    answer: `Answer: C`,
    exp: `Explanation: Water cools the combustible and the water vapours formed also surround the combustible material, cutting off the supply of air. thus, the fire is extinguished. The most common fire extinguisher is water. But for fires involving electrical equipment and inflammable materials like petrol, carbon dioxide (CO2) is the best extinguisher. CO2, being heavier than oxygen, covers the fire like a blanket. Since the contact between the fuel and oxygen is cut off, the fire is controlled. It does not harm the electrical equipment. CO2 can be stored at high pressure as a liquid in cylinders. When released from the cylinder, CO2 expands enormously in volume and cools down. Another way to get CO2 is to release a lot of dry powder of chemicals like sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) or potassium bicarbonate. On coming near the fire, these chemicals decompose to give off CO2.`

The main regions of Gondwana rocks are found in West Bengal, Jharkhand and Odisha. There are four types of coal found in India: Anthracite (Best quality of coal found only in Jammu & Kashmir); Bituminous (Second best quality of coal); Lignite (Found in Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Jammu & Kashmir). Coal accounts for approx. 67 % of total commercial energy produced in India and 98% of India’s total account is found in Gondwana rocks of Moran region. The main regions of Gondwana rocks are found in West Bengal, Jharkhand and,  Odisha. The first effort made to extract coal with modern technology in India was at Ranigunj coal region in West Bengal. Types of coal on the basis of carbon content: Anthracite is the best quality of coal which carries 80 to 95 per cent carbon content. It ignites slowly with a blue flame. It has the highest calorific value. It is found in small quantity in Jammu and Kashmir. Bituminous carries 60 to 80 per cent of carbon content and a low level of moisture content. It is widely used and has high calorific value. It is found in Jharkhand, West Bengal, Odisha, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. Lignite is often brown in colour. It carries 40 to 55 per cent carbon content. It is an intermediate stage which happens during the alteration of woody matter into coal. It has high moisture content so it gives smoke when burnt. It is found in Rajasthan, Lakhimpur (Assam), and Tamil Nadu. Peat has less than 40 per cent carbon content. It is in the first stage of transformation from wood to coal. It has low calorific value and burns like wood.`

    answer: `Answer: A`,
    exp: `Explanation: Carbonization is a slow pyrolysis process in which biomass is converted into a highly carbonaceous, charcoal-like material. Typically, carbonization consists of heating the biomass in an oxygen-free or oxygen-limited environment, and reaction conditions are tailored to maximize the production of char. Traditionally, charcoal production is one of the oldest chemical conversion processes known to mankind. Even today, charcoal production continues on a large scale worldwide, and is still making,  use—in part—of tradition charcoal kilns. Furthermore, there is renewed interest to carbonization, both from a scientific and a commercial point of view, for the production and application of biochar and torrefied biomass. This chapter gives an overview of carbonization, its chemistry, and the physicochemical properties of the resulting products. It also highlights the effects of feedstock properties and process conditions and concludes with an overview of traditional and modern carbonization techniques.`

    ],
    answer: `Answer: D`,
    exp: `Answer: D
Explanation: Angora wool or Angora fiber refers to the downy coat
produced by the Angora rabbit. While their names are similar,
Angora fiber is distinct from mohair, which comes from the Angora
goat. Angora is known for its softness, low micron count (i.e. thin
fibers), and what knitters refer to as a halo (fluffiness). It is also
known for its silky texture.Angora rabbits produce coats in a variety
of colors, from white to black. Good quality angora fiber is around
12-16 microns in diameter, and can cost around 10 - 16 dollars per
ounce. It felts very easily, even on the animal itself if the animal is
not groomed frequently.The fiber is normally blended with wool to
give the yarn elasticity, as angora fiber is not naturally elastic. The
blend decreases the softness and halo as well as the price of the
finished object.
The name Pashmina has been derived from a Persian word “Pashm”
meaning a weavable fiber precisely wool. The wool used for making
Pashmina comes from a special breed of Kashmiri goat found in the
high altitude regions of the Himalayas. The 15th century ruler of
Kashmir, Zayn-ul-Abidin, is said to be the founder of the wool
industry in Kashmir. However, the history of these shawls can be
traced back to the 3rd century BC. Pashmina has been an integral
part of the traditional wear for centuries. In the earlier times, it
was only worn by kings and queens and thus denoted royalty. The art
of weaving Pashmina has been passed on as a legacy from generations
to generations in the state of Kashmir. A good Pashmina shawl
requires an expert hand for spinning, weaving and creating
embroidery.

Explanation: The rearing of silkworms for obtaining silk is called
sericulture.The female silk moth lays hundreds of eggs, from which
hatch larvae which are called caterpillars or silkworms. They grow in
size and when the caterpillar is ready to enter the next stage of its
life history called pupa, it first weaves a net to hold itself. Then it
swings its head from side to side in the form of the figure of eight
(8). During these movements of the head, the caterpillar secretes
fibre made of a protein which hardens on exposure to air and
becomes silk fibre.

    ],
    answer: `Answer: D`,
    exp: `Answer: D
Explanation: Heat Transfer: The movement of heat from a warmer
object to a colder one - when two substances at different
temperatures are mixed together, heat flows from the warmer body
to the cooler body until they reach the same temperature (Zeroth
Law of Thermodynamics - Thermal Equilibrium). Part of the heat lost
by the warmer body is transferred t the cooler body and part is lost
to the surrounding object or the air.
A. Convection is the process of heat transfer by the bulk movement
of molecules within fluids such as gases and liquids. The initial heat
transfer between the object and the fluid takes place through
conduction, but the bulk heat transfer happens due to the motion of
the fluid.
 Convection is the process of heat transfer in fluids by the
actual motion of matter.
 It happens in liquids and gases.
 It may be natural or forced.
 It involves a bulk transfer of portions of the fluid.
How is Heat Transferred through Convection?
When a fluid is heated from below, thermal expansion takes place.
The lower layers of the fluid, which are hotter, become less dense.
We know that colder fluid is denser. Due to buoyancy, the less
dense, hotter part of the fluid rises up. And the colder, denser fluid
replaces it. This process is repeated when this part also gets heated
and rises up to be replaced by the colder upper layer. This is how
the heat is transferred through convection.
Types of Convection: There are two types of convection, and they
are:
1. Natural convection
2. Forced convection
1. Natural convection: When convection takes place due to buoyant
force as there is a difference in densities caused by the difference
in temperatures it is known as natural convection.Examples of
natural convection are oceanic winds.
2. Forced convection: When external sources such as fans and
pumps are used for creating induced convection, it is known as
forced convection.Examples of forced convection are using water
heaters or geysers for instant heating of water and using a fan on a
hot summer day.
B. Conduction is the transfer of energy in the form of heat or
electricity from one atom to another within an object by direct
contact. Conduction occurs in solids, liquids, and gases. However,
solids transfer energy most efficiently since the molecules in solids
are most tightly packed, and the molecules are closer together, as
shown in this figure. For liquids and gases, the density of the
particles are generally lower than those of solids and the particles
are farther apart, so the energy transfer is less efficient.
There are two main types of conduction:
1. Conduction of heat occurs when molecules increase in
temperature; they vibrate, and this vibration and movement passes
the heat energy to the surrounding molecules. Some examples of
conduction of heat are accidentally touching a hot pot, or when a
heating pad is applied to you directly and warms your muscles.
2. Conduction of electricity occurs due to the movement of
electrically charged particles through a medium. This movement can
result in an electric current, which may be carried by electrons or
ions. An example of electrical conduction is when you accidentally
get electrocuted when you touch a live wire because your body
contains water, which is a conductor of electricity. Another example
is when electricity passes through wires, which are conductors, so
we can watch TV or use a computer.`

    answer: `Answer: A`,
    exp: `Answer: A
Explanation: During the day, the land gets heated faster than the
water. The air over the land becomes hotter and rises up. The cooler
air from the sea rushes in towards the land to take its place. The
warm air from the land moves towards the sea to complete the cycle.
The air from the sea is called the sea breeze. To receive the cooler
sea breeze, the windows of the houses in coastal areas are made to
face the sea. At night it is exactly the reverse. The water cools
down more slowly than the land. So, the cool air from the land moves
towards the sea. This is called the land breeze. Dark surfaces
absorb more heat and, therefore, we feel comfortable with dark
coloured clothes in the winter. Light coloured clothes reflect most
of the heat that falls on them and, therefore, we feel more
comfortable wearing them in the summer.

Explanation: Neutral solution is a solution whose pH is close to 7.
They prefer remaining at a perfect balance.Usually a neutral solution
is neither acidic nor basic. It doesn't imply that the neutral solution
lack charged ions.
Natural Indicator is a type of indicator that can be found naturally
and can determine whether the substance is an acidic substance or a
basic substance. Some examples of natural indicators are red
cabbage, turmeric, grape juice, turnip skin, curry powder, cherries,
beetroots, onion, tomato, etc.
Acid rain, or acid deposition, is a broad term that includes any form
of precipitation with acidic components, such as sulfuric or nitric
acid that fall to the ground from the atmosphere in wet or dry
forms. This can include rain, snow, fog, hail or even dust that is
acidic.
Acid rain results when sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides
(NOX) are emitted into the atmosphere and transported by wind and
air currents. The SO2 and NOX react with water, oxygen and other
chemicals to form sulfuric and nitric acids. These then mix with
water and other materials before falling to the ground.
While a small portion of the SO2 and NOX that cause acid rain is
from natural sources such as volcanoes, most of it comes from the
burning of fossil fuels. The major sources of SO2 and NOX in the
atmosphere are:
1. Burning of fossil fuels to generate electricity. Two thirds of
SO2 and one fourth of NOX in the atmosphere come from electric
power generators.
2. Vehicles and heavy equipment.
3. Manufacturing, oil refineries and other industries.
Winds can blow SO2 and NOX over long distances and across borders
making acid rain a problem for everyone and not just those who live
close to these sources.

adding basic substances.
Our stomach contains hydrochloric acid. It helps us to digest food.
But too much of acid in the stomach causes indigestion, which is
painful. To relieve indigestion, we take an antacid such as milk of
magnesia, which contains magnesium hydroxide. It neutralises the
effect of excessive acid.
When an ant bites, it injects the acidic liquid (formic acid) into the
skin. The effect of the acid can be neutralised by rubbing moist
baking soda (sodium hydrogencarbonate) or calamine solution, which
contains zinc carbonate.

    ],
    answer: `Answer: A`,
    exp: `Answer: A
Explanation: Exothermic reactions are reactions or processes that
release energy, usually in the form of heat or light. In an exothermic
reaction, energy is released because the total energy of the
products is less than the total energy of the reactants. For this
reason, the change in enthalpy, Delta H, for an
exothermic reaction will always be negative. In the presence of
water, a strong acid will dissociate quickly and release heat, so it is
an exothermic reaction.
Endothermic reactions are reactions that require external energy,
usually in the form of heat, for the reaction to proceed. Since
endothermic reactions draw in heat from their surroundings, they
tend to cause their environments to cool down. They are also
generally non-spontaneous, since endothermic reactions yield
products that are higher in energy than the reactants. As such, the
change in enthalpy for an endothermic reaction is always positive. In
order to melt the ice cube, heat is required, so the process is
endothermic.

    ],
    answer: `Answer: D`,
    exp: `Answer: D
Explanation: Acid, any substance that in water solution tastes sour,
changes the colour of certain indicators (e.g., reddens
blue litmus paper), reacts with some metals (e.g., iron)
toliberate hydrogen, reacts with bases to form salts, and promotes
certain chemical reactions (acid catalysis). Examples of acids include
the inorganic substances known as the mineral acids—sulfuric, nitric,
hydrochloric, and phosphoric acids—and the
organic compounds belonging to the carboxylic acid, sulfonic acid,
and phenol groups.
Acids may be identified as either strong or weak acids based on how
completely they dissociate into their ions in water. A strong acid,
such as hydrochloric acid, completely dissociates into its ions in
water. A weak acid only partly dissociates into its ions, so the
solution contains water, ions, and the acid (e.g., acetic acid).

Explanation: The tropical region has generally a hot climate because
of its location around the equator. Even in the coldest month the
temperature is generally higher than about 15°C. During hot
summers, the temperature may cross 40°C. Days and nights are
almost equal in length throughout the year. These regions get plenty
of rainfall. An important feature of this region is the tropical
rainforests. Tropical rainforests are found in Western Ghats and
Assam in India, Southeast Asia, Central America and Central Africa.
The lion-tailed macaque (also called Beard ape) lives in the
rainforests of Western Ghats. Its most outstanding feature is the
silver-white mane, which surrounds the head from the cheeks down
to its chin. It is a good climber feeds mainly on fruits, seeds, young
leaves, stems, flowers and buds. This beard ape also searches for
insects under the bark of the trees. Since it is able to get sufficient
food on the trees, it rarely comes down on the ground.

    answer: `Answer: B`,
    exp: `Answer: B
Explanation: Wind is the movement of air caused by the uneven
heating of the Earth by the sun. It does not have much substance—
you cannot see it or hold it—but you can feel its force. It can dry
your clothes in summer and chill you to the bone in winter. It is
strong enough to carry sailing ships across the ocean and rip huge
trees from the ground. It is the great equalizer of the atmosphere,
transporting heat, moisture, pollutants, and dust great distances
around the globe. Landforms, processes, and impacts of wind are
called Aeolian landforms, processes, and impacts.
Differences in atmospheric pressure generate winds. At the
Equator, the sun warms the water and land more than it does the
rest of the globe. Warm equatorial air rises higher into the
atmosphere and migrates toward the poles. This is a low-pressure
system. At the same time, cooler, denser air moves over Earth’s
surface toward the Equator to replace the heated air. This is a highpressure system. Winds generally blow from high-pressure areas to
low-pressure areas.
The boundary between these two areas is called a front. The
complex relationships between fronts cause different types of wind
and weather patterns.
Prevailing winds are winds that blow from a single direction over a
specific area of the Earth. Areas where prevailing winds meet are
called convergence zones. Generally, prevailing winds blow east-west
rather than north-south. This happens because
Earth’s rotation generates what is known as the Coriolis effect.
The Coriolis effect makes wind systems twist counter-clockwise in
the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern
Hemisphere.
The Coriolis effect causes some winds to travel along the edges of
the high-pressure and low-pressure systems. These are
called geostrophic winds. In 1857, Dutch meteorologist Christoph
Buys Ballot formulated a law about geostrophic winds: When you
stand with your back to the wind in the Northern Hemisphere, low
pressure is always to your left. (In the Southern Hemisphere, lowpressure systems will be on your right.)

Explanation: The Sun's rays are straight at the equator, so the
areas around the equator receive maximum heat.The warm air rises,
and the cooler air from the regions in the 0-30 degrees latitude belt
on either side of the equator moves in. These winds blow from the
north and the south towards the equator. At the poles, the air is
colder than that at latitudes about 60 degrees. The warm air at
these latitudes rises up and the cold wind from the polar regions
rushes in, to take its place. In this way, wind circulation is set up
from the poles to the warmer latitudes.

Explanation: In summer, near the equator the land warms up faster
and most of the time the temperature of the land is higher than
that of water in the oceans. The air over the land gets heated and
rises. This causes the winds to flow from the oceans towards the
land. These are monsoon winds.
In winter, the direction of the wind flow gets reversed; it flows
from the land to the ocean.The winds from the oceans carry water
and bring rain. It is a part of the water cycle. The monsoon winds
carry water and it rains.

    answer: `Answer: C`,
    exp: `Answer: C
Explanation: Thunderstorms develop in hot, humid tropical areas
like India very frequently. The rising temperatures produce strong
upward rising winds. These winds carry water droplets upwards,
where they freeze, and fall down again. The swift movement of the
falling water droplets along with the rising air create lightning and
sound. It is this event that we call a thunderstorm.
The centre of a cyclone is a calm area. It is called the eye of the
storm. A large cyclone is a violently rotating mass of air in the
atmosphere, 10 to 15 km high. The diameter of the eye varies from
10 to 30 km. It is a region free of clouds and has light winds. Around
this calm and clear eye, there is a cloud region of about 150 km in
size. In this region there are high-speed winds (150-250 km/h) and
thick clouds with heavy rain. Away from this region the wind speed
gradually decreases. The formation of a cyclone is a very complex
process.

    answer: `Answer: B`,
    exp: `Answer: B
Explanation: India's coast is extremely vulnerable to cyclones. With
a coastline of 7517 km, the country is exposed to nearly 10 per cent
of the world's tropical cyclones. Although cyclones affect the entire
coast of India, the eastern coast is significantly more prone to
cyclones as compared to the western coast.
East coast of India faces the Bay of Bengal while the west coast of
India is situated on the shores of Arabian Sea.Bay of Bengal is very
active in the months of October to December during the end phase
of South west monsoon and whole of North east monsoon period.
During these periods, the easterlies pick up moisture from BoB and
the remnants of typhoons from Malay peninsula enter the waters of
BoB and form low pressure troughs. They further intensify in
strength due to favourable warm temperatures of sea and increased
sea travel.
The cyclones then travel in eastern direction due to prevailing
easterlies and cross the shores of eastern states of India. The
entire east coast from Tamil Nadu to West Bengal is prone to
cyclones. Cities like Chennai, Nagapattinam, Rameshwaram,
Srikakulam, Gopalpur, Cox Bazaar(Bangladesh) are extremely prone
to cyclones.
Cyclones do originate in Arabian sea but they mostly tend to move
away from west coast of India towards Oman, Yemen or Somalia.
This is due to strong winds from BoB and peninsular India pushing
the cyclones/depressions further away.

    ],
    answer: `Answer: D`,
    exp: `Answer: D
Explanation: A tropical cyclone is a storm system, characterised by
a low-pressure centre surrounded by a spiral arrangement of
thunderstorms that produce strong winds and heavy rain.
A characteristic feature of tropical cyclones is the eye, a central
region of clear skies, warm temperatures, and low atmospheric
pressure. Typically, atmospheric pressure at the surface of Earth is
about 1,000 millibars. At the centre of a tropical cyclone, however,
it is typically around 960 millibars, and in a very intense “super
typhoon” of the western Pacific it may be as low as 880 millibars. In
addition to low pressure at the centre, there is also a rapid variation
of pressure across the storm, with most of the variation occurring
near the centre. This rapid variation results in a large pressure
gradient force, which is responsible for the strong winds present in
the eyewall
Horizontal winds within the eye, on the other hand, are light. In
addition, there is a weak sinking motion, or subsidence, as air is
pulled into the eyewall at the surface. As the air subsides, it
compresses slightly and warms, so that temperatures at the centre
of a tropical cyclone are some 5.5 °C (10 °F) higher than in other
regions of the storm. Because warmer air can hold more moisture
before condensation occurs, the eye of the cyclone is generally free
of clouds. Reports of the air inside the eye being “oppressive” or
“sultry” are most likely a psychological response to the rapid change
from high winds and rain in the eyewall to calm conditions in the eye.

    answer: `Answer: A`,
    exp: `Answer: A
Explanation: Electric potential, the amount of work needed to move
a unit charge from a reference point to a specific point against
an electric field. Typically, the reference point is Earth, although
any point beyond the influence of the electric field charge can be
used.
The potential energy for a positive charge increases when it moves
against an electric field and decreases when it moves with the
electric field; the opposite is true for a negative charge. Unless the
unit charge crosses a changing magnetic field, its potential at any
given point does not depend on the path taken.
Although the concept of electric potential is useful in
understanding electrical phenomena, only differences in potential
energy are measurable. If an electric field is defined as the force
per unit charge, then by analogy an electric potential can be thought
of as the potential energy per unit charge. Therefore, the work done
in moving a unit charge from one point to another (e.g., within
an electric circuit) is equal to the difference in potential energies at
each point. In the International System of Units (SI), electric
potential is expressed in units of joules per coulomb (i.e., volts), and
differences in potential energy are measured with a voltmeter.

    ],
    answer: `Answer: C`,
    exp: `Answer: C
Explanaton: Push or pull of an object is considered a force. Push and
pull come from the objects interacting with one another. Terms like
stretch and squeeze can also be used to denote force.
In Physics, force is defined as: The push or pull on an object with
mass that causes it to change its velocity.
Force is an external agent capable of changing the state of rest or
motion of a particular body. It has a magnitude and a direction. The
direction towards which the force is applied is known as the
direction of the force, and the application of force is the point
where force is applied.The Force can be measured using a spring
balance. The SI unit of force is Newton(N).
In physics, motion is defined as the change in position with respect
to time. In simpler words, motion refers to the movement of a body.
Typically, motion can either be described as:
1. Change in speed
2. Change in direction
The Force has different effects and here are some of them.
 Force can make a body which is at rest to move.
 It can stop a moving body or slow it down.
 It can accelerate the speed of a moving body.
 It can also change the direction of a moving body along with its
shape and size.

    ],
    answer: `Answer: C`,
    exp: `Answer: C
Explanation: According to Newtons second law,
The rate of change of linear momentum of a body is directly
proportional to the external force applied on the body , and takes
place always in the direction of the force applied.
So the rate of change of momentum is Force i.e. Newtons second law
helps us to derive an equation for force.
Consider a body of mass’m’ moving with velocity’v’.Its momentum is
given by p=mv…..(1)
Let F be an external force applied on the body in the direction of
motion of the body.Let dp is a small change in linear momentum of
the body in a small time dt
Rate of change of linear momentum of the body =dp/dt
According to Newtons second law , F is directly proportional to
dp/dt
F=k*(dp/dt),where k is contant of proportionality
F=k*(d(mv)/dt), F=km(dv/dt)
But dv/dt=a, the acceleration of the body so, F=kma…….(2)
the value of k depends on the unit adopted for measuring the force
.Both in SI and cgs systems , the unit of force is chosen, so that the
constant of proportionality (k) is equal to 1.
from equation(2)
F=ma…….(3)

Explanation: First of all, even infinite no. Of electrons can't be
summed up to 1 Coulomb, what you actually mean is -1 Coulomb.
We know that, Charge on 1 electron = -1.6 × 10^-19 Coulomb,
Now, simple application of unitary method,
No. Of electrons on -1 Coulomb of charge = 1/(1.6×10^-19) = 0.625 ×

    answer: `Answer: C`,
    exp: `
Explanation: The micro-organisms which convert the dead plants and
animals to humus are known as decomposers. These microorganisms
play an important role in the forest. The presence of humus ensures
that the nutrients of the dead plants and animals are released into
the soil. From there, these nutrients are again absorbed by the
roots of the living plants and the dead animals become food for
vultures, crows, jackals and insects.” In this way, the nutrients are
cycled. So, nothing goes waste in a forest.

    answer: `Answer: A`,
    exp: `
Explanation: A primary consumer is an organism that feeds
on primary producers. Organisms of this type make up the
second trophic level and are consumed or predated by secondary
consumers, tertiary consumers or apex predators. Primary
consumers are usually herbivores that feed on autotrophic plants,
which produce their own food through photosynthesis. Several other
feeding strategies are also used by primary consumers: algivores
feed on photosynthetic algae; frugivores feed on the fruiting bodies
of plants; nectarivores feed on plant nectar; folivores feed
on leaf material; granivores feed on grains and seeds while
fungivores feed on heterotrophic fungi such as mushrooms. Many
primary consumers adopt several different feeding strategies in
order to maximize the effectiveness of foraging behavior.
Primary consumers often have specific physiological adaptions that
allow them to process the carbohydrates produced through
photosynthesis, which can be hard to break down and extract
nutrition from; herbivores often have rows of wide, flat teeth are
used to rasp, grind and tear tough plant material and woody stems.
Many primary consumers also have symbiotic bacteria, which live
within a special organ called the cecum and assist with the digestion
of plant material.
Primary consumers exist in all biomes and fill a wide variety
of niches. They can range from microscopic organisms such
as zooplankton to animals as big as elephants.

    ],
    answer: `Answer: A`,
    exp: `Explanation: Sperm and ovum, both are examples of single celled bodies. The fusion of both is called fertilization, the result of which is the formation of zygote. The cells of zygote divide continuously, to form a ball of cells, after which, the cells differentiate and divide into tissues and organs. This is called an embryo. The embryo undergoes development after being implanted on the wall of the,  uterus. The stage of embryo development, wherein all the body parts are distinguishable, is called foetus. Animals which give birth to offsprings, are called viviparous; and the ones which develop through eggs are called oviparous. Statement 2 is not correct, because fertilisation in some oviparous animals occurs outside the body, and in some, inside the body. Fertilisation in chicken is an example of internal fertilization. In many animals (frogs, toad, fish, starfish, etc), fertilization occurs outside the female body. In these animals, fertilization occurs in water. As soon as the egg is released from the female body, males release the sperms. All the sperms swim in the water with the help of their tail.

Air contains water vapour, and when air comes in contact with a cold surface, the water vapour cools down and condenses to form droplets of water.  Evaporation and transpiration, both change water from liquid to vapour.

    answer: `Answer: C`,
    exp: `Answer: C Explanation:  Water enters the atmosphere through evaporation and and transpiration. For water cycle, water vapour must be present in the atmosphere.  Condensation plays a major role in bringing the water back to the earth’s surface, while through transpiration, water enters the atmosphere.  In the atmosphere, water remains in the form of clouds. This water reaches the earth’s surface in the form of rain, snow and hail.  In the last step, water reaches the oceans through the rivers and streams. This is how the water cycle is completed. It is responsible for maintaining a fixed volume of water on earth.

Explanation: About 72 percent of the Earth's surface is watercovered, and the oceans hold about 96.5 percent of all Earth's water. Water also exists in the air as water vapor, in rivers and lakes, in icecaps and glaciers, in the ground as soil moisture and in aquifers, and even in .Freshwater makes up a very small fraction of all water on the planet. While nearly 70 percent of the world is covered by water, only 2.5 percent of it is fresh. The rest is saline and ocean-based. Even then, just 1 percent of our freshwater is easily accessible, with much of it trapped in glaciers and snowfields. Some 72 percent of Earth is covered in water, but 97 percent of that is salty ocean water and not suitable for drinking.The rest are in the form of lakes ,etc.So the percentage remaining available for us is 0.006 %.

    answer: `Answer: B`,
    exp: `Answer: B
Explanation: Watering harvesting means capturing rain water, where it falls and capture the runoff from, catchment and streams etc. Generally, water harvesting is direct rainwater collection. This collected water could be stored for later use and recharged into the ground water again. Rain is primary water source lakes, ground water and rivers are the secondary water source. Rainwater could be easily collected in plastic tanks. They are easy to install and handle. They are comparatively cheap from underground tanks, but definitely take up space. For harvesting rain water you first calculate the possible rain, you can do this by getting information from Meteorological Bureau of your area. They would give you information about the average rainfall during whole month.For instance if you have 600mm rains every year and the area of your roof is 200 square meters, and you are interested to catch the whole area for one month storage. Your tank volume must be 10,000 liters. This quantity of water will give 10,000/30 about 33 liters water per day. Water harvesting can be undertaken through a variety of ways 1. Capturing runoff from rooftops 2. Capturing runoff from local catchments 3. Capturing seasonal floodwaters from local streams 4. Conserving water through watershed management

    answer: `Answer: C`,
    exp: `Explanation: Deforestation means that less carbon dioxide will be taken up by the plants, resulting in increase in its amount in the atmosphere. This will lead to global warming as carbon dioxide traps the heat rays reflected by the earth.Deforestation also lowers the ground water level. The major reason behind the changes of soil properties is deforestation. This causes soil erosion. Soil erosion lowers the content of humus in soil and soil fertility also declines. Soil erosion also causes desertification.Deforestation adversely affects the water holding capacity of the soil. The movement of water from the soil surface into the ground (infiltration rate) is reduced. This is responsible for floods.`

    exp: `Explanation: Of the various places meant for the protection of the flora and fauna, sanctuaries, national parks and biosphere reserves are the primary. Wildlife sanctuaries provide protection and suitable living conditions to wild animals. Sanctuaries are places where killing (poaching) or capturing of animals is strictly prohibited. Hence, the wildlife and their habitat are protected from any form of interference. The local population and certain human interference is allowed, which makes it different from biosphere reserves. National Parks are protected spaces for the wildlife, where any form of human interference is prohibited. Hence, the wildlife can freely live here and utilise the natural resources. The biosphere reserves help to maintain the variety of plants, animals and microorganisms along with the culture generally found in an area. A biosphere reserve is so large that it can have several protected areas within it. These protected areas are constructed to protect the biodiversity of a specific area. A biosphere reserve also protects the culture of a given area.

    exp: `Explanation: Ex-situ conservation involves maintenance and breeding of endangered plants and animals under partially or wholly controlled conditions in specific areas including zoo, gardens, nurseries, etc. That is, the conservation of selected plants and animals in selected areas outside their natural habitat is known as ex-situ conservation. The stresses on living organisms due to competition for food, water, space etc. can be avoided by ex-situ conservation there by providing conditions necessary for a secure life and breeding. For ex-situ conservations the species to be conserved should be identified followed by adoption of different ex-situ methods such as, longterm captive breeding and propagation for the species which have lost their habitats permanently, short-term propagation and release of the animals in their natural habitat, animal translocation and reintroduction and advanced technology in the service of endangered species. The different advantages of ex-situ conservation are, 1. It gives longer life time and breeding activity to animals 2. Genetic techniques can be utilized in the process 3. Captivity breed species can again be reintroduced in the wild The ex-situ conservation strategies include botanical gardens, zoological gardens, conservation stands and gene, pollen, seed, seedling, tissue culture and DNA banks.

    answer: `Answer: A`,
    exp: `Explanation: The term biodiversity (from “biological diversity”) refers to the variety of life on Earth at all its levels, from genes to ecosystems, and can encompass the evolutionary, ecological, and cultural processes that sustain life. Biodiversity is important to most aspects of our lives. We value biodiversity for many reasons, some utilitarian, some intrinsic. This means we value biodiversity both for what it provides to humans, and for the value it has in its own right. Utilitarian values include the many basic needs humans obtain from biodiversity such as food, fuel, shelter, and medicine. Further, ecosystems provide crucial services such as pollination, seed dispersal, climate regulation, water purification, nutrient cycling, and control of agricultural pests. Biodiversity also holds value for potential benefits not yet recognized, such as new medicines and other possible unknown services. Biodiversity has cultural value to humans as well, for spiritual or religious reasons for instance. The intrinsic value of biodiversity refers to its inherent worth, which is independent of its value to anyone or anything else. This is more of a philosophical concept, which can be thought of as the inalienable right to exist. Finally, the value of biodiversity can also be understood through the lens of the relationships we form and strive for with each other and the rest of nature. We may value biodiversity because of how it shapes who we are, our relationships to each other, and social norms. These relational values are part of peoples’ individual or collective sense of wellbeing, responsibility for, and connection with the environment. The different values placed on biodiversity are important because they can influence the conservation decisions people make every day.`

    question: `121. The term Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) is generally used to describe:`,
    options: [
        'A. Wastes from industrial processes, construction and demolition debris.',
        'B. Wastes from Private homes, commercial establishments and institutions.',
        'C. Mining wastes',
        'D. Agricultural wastes',
    ],
    answer: `Answer: B`,
    exp: `Explanation: Answer: B Municipal Solid Waste, also called garbage or trash, is nonhazardous disposable materials generated by households, institutions, industries, agriculture, and sewage. It is made up of waste, organics, and recyclable materials, with the municipality overseeing its disposal. Typically, municipal solid waste is collected, sperate and sent to either a landfill or municipal recycling center for processing. Municipal solid waste may contain a variety of pathogens, a source of which is often disposable diapers—it has been found that as many as 10% of the fecally soiled disposable diapers entering landfills contain enteroviruses. Another primary source of pathogens is sewage biosolids, where codisposal is practiced. Pathogens may also be present in domestic pet waste (e.g., cat litter) and food wastes. Municipal solid wastes from households have been found to average 7.7 × 108 coliforms and 4.7 × 108 fecal coliforms per gram. Salmonella have also been detected in domestic solid waste. In unlined landfills, such pathogens may be present in the leachate beneath landfills. Municipal solid waste represents a major crisis for rural communities because of the lack of awareness of the effects of people dumping their waste in the water canals causing water pollution as well as visual pollution. Others might burn the MSW in the streets causing air pollution as well as visual pollution. The municipal solid waste consists of organic waste, waste paper, plastic waste, tin cans, aluminum cans, textile, glass, etc. as discussed in Chapter 5. It is always recommended to establish a transfer station in rural communities because of low quantity. The transfer station consists of a conveyer belt for sorting, a hydraulic press for compacting paper, tin cans, textile, etc., and a ball mill to crush glass waste. It is always recommended to establish centralized recycling facilities among a number of rural communities.`

The output of waste into the water bodies from industries, agriculture, and urban communities generally exceeds the biological capacities of aquatic systems. Runoff of chemical fertilizers from fields is a major cause. When organic matter exceeds the capacity of those microorganisms in water that break it down and recycle it, it encourages rapid growth, or blooms of algae. When they die, remains of the dead algae add further to the organic wastes already in water; eventually, water becomes deficient in oxygen.`

    ],
    answer: `Answer: C`,
    exp: `Answer: C
Explanation: Plane mirrors are simply flat mirrors without curves.
Because these can be found almost anywhere, the average person is
incredibly familiar with them (even if they don't know the technical
term). While the first manmade mirrors were made from intensely
polished bronze, silver and other metals, today most mirrors are
made from glass sheets finished with a thin layer of aluminum. That
said, plane mirrors can be made from liquid as well: Gallium and
mercury can be used for this purpose. Regardless of material
construction, however, all flat mirrors function the same way. They
reflect rays of light, producing an image.
Characteristics of the image formed by a plane mirror :
 It is virtual
 It is erect and of same size as the object
 The distance of object from the plane mirror is same as the
distance of image from the plabe mirror.
One of the important characteristic of the image is that it is
laterally inverted. It means if you raise your left hand it would
appear in the plane mirror that you have raised your right hand.

    answer: `Answer: B`,
    exp: `Answer: B
Explanation: The convex lens forms a erect and magnified image.A convex lens converges (bends inward) the light generally falling on it. Therefore, it is called a converging lens. The concave lens always forms a virtual, erect, and smaller in size image than the object. The concave lens diverges (bends outward) the light and is called a diverging lens. Concave Mirror: If a hollow sphere is cut into parts and the outer surface of the cut part is painted. Then it becomes a mirror with its inner surface as the reflecting surface This kind of mirror is known as a concave mirror. Light converges at a point when it strikes and reflects back from the reflecting surface of the concave mirror. Hence, it is also known as a converging mirror. When the concave mirror is placed very close to the object, a magnified and virtual image is obtained. But if we increase the distance between the object and the mirror then the size of the image reduces and a real image is formed. So the image formed by the concave mirror can be small or large and it can also be real or virtual. Convex Mirror: If the other cut part of the hollow sphere is painted from inside, then its outer surface becomes the reflecting surface. This kind of mirror is known as convex mirror. A convex mirror is also known as a diverging mirror as this mirror diverges light when they strike on its reflecting surface. Virtual, erect and diminished images are always formed with convex mirrors, irrespective of the distance between the object and the mirror. Apart from other applications, the convex mirror is mostly used as a rearview mirror in vehicles. Spherical mirrors are the mirrors having curved surfaces which are painted on one of the sides. Spherical mirrors in which inward surfaces are painted are known as convex mirrors while the spherical mirrors in which outward surfaces are painted are known as concave mirrors. Concave mirrors are also known as a converging mirror since the rays converge after falling on the concave mirror while the convex mirrors are known as diverging mirrors as the rays diverge after falling on the convex mirror. In this article, we will learn about image formation by concave and convex mirrors.

Explanation: When a ray of light approaches a smooth polished surface and the light ray bounces back, it is called the reflection of light. The incident light ray which lands upon the surface is said to be reflected off the surface. The ray that bounces back is called the reflected ray. If a perpendicular were to be drawn on reflecting surface, it would be called normal. The figure below shows the reflection of an incident beam on a plane mirror.Image formation on a mirror is caused by reflection. Refraction and diffraction have no role to play in it.

    answer: `Answer: D`,

Explanation: Refraction is the bending of a wave when it enters a
medium where its speed is different. We can define it as:Refraction
is the change in direction of a wave passing from one medium to
another or from a gradual change in the medium
Refraction of light is one of the most usually observed
phenomena which includes refraction of light through prism, but
other waves like sound waves and water waves also experience
refraction.
Laws of Refraction of Light:
Laws of refraction state that:
1. The incident ray, refracted ray, and the normal to the interface
of two media at the point of incidence all lie on the same plane.
2. The ratio of sine of angle of incidence to the sine of angle of
refraction is a constant. This is also known as Snell’s law of
refraction.

        'D. Light waves will always travel in a straight line, even if they come into contact with another object.',

    ],
    answer: `Answer: D`,
    exp: `Answer: D
Explanation: Once light has been produced, it will keep travelling in
a straight line until it hits something else. Shadows are evidence of
light travelling in straight lines. An object blocks light so that it
can’t reach the surface where we see the shadow. Light fills up all of
the space before it hits the object, but the whole region between
the object and the surface is in shadow. Shadows don’t appear
totally dark because there is still some light reaching the surface
that has been reflected off other objects.
Once light has hit another surface or particles, it is then absorbed,
reflected (bounces off), scattered (bounces off in all directions),
refracted (direction and speed changes) or transmitted (passes
straight through).

    ],
    answer: `Answer: B`,
    exp: `Answer: B
Explanation: A concave lens is a lens that possesses at least one
surface that curves inwards. It is a diverging lens, meaning that it
spreads out light rays that have been refracted through it. A
concave lens is thinner at its centre than at its edges, and is used to
correct short-sightedness (myopia).
After light rays have passed through the lens, they appear to come
from a point called the principal focus. This is the point onto which
the collimated light that moves parallel to the axis of the lens is
focused. The image formed by a concave lens is virtual, meaning that
it will appear to be farther away than it actually is, and therefore
smaller than the object itself. Curved mirrors often have this
effect, which is why many (especially on cars) come with a warning:
Objects in mirror are closer than they appear. The image will also be
upright, meaning not inverted, as some curved reflective surfaces
and lenses have been known to do.The lens formula that is used to
work out the position and nature of an image formed by a lens can be
expressed as follows: 1/u + 1/v = 1/f, where u and v are the
distances of the object and image from the lens, respectively, and f
is the focal length of the lens.

Each chromosome is made of protein and a single molecule of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Passed from parents to offspring, DNA contains the specific instructions that make each type of living creature unique. The term chromosome comes from the Greek words for color (chroma) and body (soma). Scientists gave this name to chromosomes because they are cell structures, or bodies, that are strongly stained by some colorful dyes used in research. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, for a total of 46 chromosomes. In fact, each species of plants and animals has a set number of chromosomes. A fruit fly, for example, has four pairs of chromosomes, while a rice plant has 12 and a dog, 39.`

Puberty involves a series of physical stages or steps that lead to the achievement of fertility and the development of the so-called secondary sex characteristics, the physical features associated with adult males and females (such as the growth of pubic hair). While puberty involves a series of biological or physical transformations, the process can also have an effect on the psychosocial and emotional development of the adolescent. Puberty usually occurs in girls between the ages of 10 and 14, while in boys it generally occurs later, between the ages of 12 and 16. In some African-American girls, puberty begins earlier, at about age 9, meaning that puberty occurs from ages 9 to 14.`

    answer: `Answer: B`,
    exp: `Explanation: sound cannot travel in vacuum.The intensity of sound is measured in decibels (dB).The number of oscillations per second is called the frequency of oscillation. Frequency is expressed in Hertz. Its symbol is Hz. A frequency of 1 Hz is one oscillation per second. Sounds of frequencies less than about 20 vibrations per second (20 Hz) cannot be detected by the human ear. On the higher side, sounds of frequencies higher than about 20,000 vibrations per second (20 kHz) are also not audible to the human ear. Thus, for human ear, the range of audible frequencies is roughly from 20 to 20,000 Hz.Some animals can hear sounds of frequencies higher than 20,000 Hz. Dogs have this ability.

    answer: `Answer: D`,
    exp: `Explanation: Friction is defined as the force that opposes the motion of a solid object over another. There are mainly four types of friction: static friction, sliding friction, rolling friction, and fluid,  friction. Friction and normal force are directly proportional to the contacting surfaces and it doesn’t depend on the hardness of the contacting surface. With the increase in relative speeds, the sliding friction reduces whereas fluid friction increases with the increase in the relative speed, also fluid friction is dependent on the viscosity of the fluid. Types of Friction Following are the friction types which depend on the types of motion: \n 1. Static Friction \n 2. Sliding Friction \n 3. Rolling Friction \n 4. Fluid Friction 1. Static friction is defined as: the frictional force that acts between the surfaces when they are at rest with respect to each other. The magnitude of the static force is equal in the opposite direction when a small amount of force is applied. When the force increases, at some point maximum static friction is reached. 2. Sliding friction is defined as: the resistance that is created between any two objects when they are sliding against each other. 3. Rolling friction is defined as: the force which resists the motion of a ball or wheel and is the weakest types of friction.,  4. Fluid friction is defined as: the friction that exsits between the layers of the fluid when they are moving relative to each other.`

        exp: `Explanation: Ethanol is a good solvent, it is also used in medicines such as tincture iodine, cough syrups, and many tonics. When large quantities of ethanol are consumed, it tends to depress the central nervous system. This results in lack of coordination, mental confusion, drowsiness, lowering of the normal inhibitions, and finally stupor. Consumption of ethanol tends to slow metabolic process. Alcohol contains empty calories and has no nutritional value. It often contributes to malnutrition because the high levels of calories in most alcoholic drinks can account for a large percentage of your daily energy requirementsEthanol is liquid at room temperature. Ethanol is commonly called alcohol and is the active ingredient of all alcoholic drinks. `

Sugarcane juice is used to prepare molasses which is fermented to give alcohol (ethanol). Some countries now use alcohol as an additive in petrol since it is a cleaner fuel which gives rise to only carbon dioxide and water on burning in sufficient air (oxygen). As the Alcohol molecule contains oxygen, it allows the engine to more completely combust the fuel, resulting in fewer emissions and thereby reducing the occurrence of environmental pollution. Since alcohol is produced from plants that harness the power of the sun, it is also considered as renewable fuel. `

        answer: `Answer: B`,
        exp: `Explanation: Bathing foam forms an insoluble substance (scum), this is caused by the reaction of soap with the calcium and magnesium salts, which cause the hardness of water. This problem is overcome by using another class of compounds called detergents as cleansing agents. Detergents are generally ammonium or sulphonate salts of long chain carboxylic acids. The charged ends of these compounds do not form insoluble precipitates with the calcium and magnesium ions in hard water. Thus, they remain effective in hard water. Detergents are usually used to make shampoos and products for cleaning clothes. `

        answer: `Answer: B`,
        exp: `Explanation: In the year 1817, Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner, a German chemist, tried to arrange the elements with similar properties into groups. He identified some groups having three elements each. So he called these groups 'triads'. In 1866, John Newlands, an English scientist arranged the then known elements in the order of increasing atomic masses. He compared the table to the octaves found in music. Therefore, he called it the ‘Law of Octaves’. The main credit for classifying elements goes to Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeléev, a Russian chemist. He was the most important contributor to the early development of a Periodic Table of elements wherein the elements were arranged on the basis of their fundamental property, the atomic mass, and also on the similarity of chemical properties. In 1913, Henry Moseley showed that the atomic number of an element is a more fundamental property than its atomic mass as described below. Accordingly, Mendeléev’s Periodic Law was modified and atomic number was adopted as the basis of Modern Periodic Table. `

        answer: `Answer: C`,
        exp: `Explanation: Mendeleev examined the relationship between the atomic masses of the elements and their physical and chemical properties. He observed that most of the elements got a place in a Periodic Table and were arranged in the order of their increasing atomic masses. It was also observed that there occurs a periodic recurrence of elements with similar physical and chemical properties. Mendeléev left some gaps in his Periodic Table.

        answer: `Answer: D`,
        exp: `Explanation: Certainly, no fixed position can be given to hydrogen in the Periodic Table. This was the first limitation of Mendeléev’s Periodic Table. He could not assign a correct position to hydrogen in his Table. Isotopes were discovered long after Mendeléev had proposed his periodic classification of elements. Isotopes of an element have similar chemical properties, but different atomic masses. Thus, isotopes of all elements posed a challenge to Mendeleev’s Periodic Law. Another problem was that the atomic masses do not increase in a regular manner in going from one element to the next. So it was not possible to predict how many elements could be discovered between two elements — especially when we consider the heavier elements. `

        answer: `Answer: D`,
        exp: `Explanation: As the effective nuclear charge acting on the valence shell electrons increases across a period, the tendency to lose electrons will decrease.

This process occurs in the chloroplast of plants. Chlorophyll traps the sunlight to reduce carbon dioxide and water into oxygen and Glucose which allows the plant to grow. Hence, Statement 1 and 2 are Correct. Water splits into oxygen, hydrogen ions, and electrons to replace the lost electrons in light-dependent reaction. As hydrogen ions pass through ATP synthase, ATP is formed. 6CO2 + 6H2O (chlorophyll + sunlight) → C6H12O6 + 6O2 (Glucose) Carbon gets into the leaf through minute pores in leaves called stomata and water goes into the plant through its roots.

        exp: `Explanation: The DNA in a cell nucleus is an information source for making proteins. If the information is changed, different proteins will be made. Different proteins will eventually lead to altered body designs. Therefore, a basic event in reproduction is the creation of a DNA copy. Cells use chemical reactions to build copies of their DNA. This creates two copies of the DNA in a reproducing cell, that will need to be separated from each other. No bio-chemical reaction is absolutely reliable. Therefore, it is only to be expected that the process of copying the DNA will have some variations each time. As a result, the DNA copies generated will be similar, but may not be identical to the original. A population of organisms fill well-defined places, or niches, in the ecosystem, by using their ability to reproduce. The consistency of DNA copying during reproduction is important for the maintenance of body design features that allows the organism to use that particular niche.

        exp: `Explanation: The formation of germ-cells or sperms takes place in the testes. These are located outside the abdominal cavity in scrotum because sperm formation requires a lower temperature than the normal body temperature. The role of the testes in the secretion of the hormone, testosterone, is to regulate the formation of sperms, and brings about changes in appearance, seen in boys at the time of puberty such as broadening of chest. In adolescent boys, sometimes, the muscles of the growing Voice Box go out of control and the voice becomes hoarse. `

        ],
        answer: `Answer: C`,
        exp: `Explanation: In asexual reproduction, if one bacterium divides, and then the resultant two bacteria divide again, the four individual bacteria generated would be very similar. There would be only very minor differences between them, generated due to small inaccuracies in DNA copying. However, if sexual reproduction is involved, greater diversity will be generated, and the second generation will have differences that they inherit from the first generation, as well as newly created differences. Variations generated during birth can be hereditary. Due to these differences, survival of the organism can increase. Two copies of the trait are inherited in each sexually reproducing organism. These two may be identical, or may be different, depending on the parentage. For example, both TT and Tt are tall plants, while only tt is a short plant. In other words, a single copy of ‘T’ is enough to make the plant tall, while both copies have to be ‘t’ for the plant to be short. Traits like ‘T’ are called dominant traits, while those that behave like ‘t’ are called recessive traits. The trait that gets expressed in phenotype is called the dominant trait and the other which fails to express is called the recessive trait. `

        answer: `Answer: D`,
        exp: `Explanation: Some species rely entirely on environmental cues. Thus, in some animals, the temperature at which fertilised eggs are kept determines whether the animals developing in the eggs will be male or female. In other animals, such as snails, individuals can change sex, indicating that sex is not genetically determined. . In human beings, the sex of the individual is largely genetically determined. Most human chromosomes have a maternal and a paternal copy, and we have 22 such pairs. But one pair, called the sex chromosomes, is different in men and women. So women are XX, while men are XY. Thus, the sex of the children will be determined by what they inherit from their father. A child who inherits an X chromosome from her father will be a girl, and one who inherits a Y chromosome from him will be a boy. `

All such preserved traces of living organisms are called fossils. There are two methods of fossil dating. One is relative. If we dig into the earth and start finding fossils, it is reasonable to suppose that the fossils we find closer to the surface are more recent than the fossils we find in deeper layers. The second way of dating fossils is by detecting the ratios of different isotopes of the same element in the fossil material. `

        ],
        answer: `Answer: B`,
        exp: `Explanation: The twinkling of a star is due to atmospheric refraction. The starlight, on entering the earth’s atmosphere, undergoes refraction continuously, before it reaches the earth. The atmospheric refraction occurs in a medium of gradually changing refractive index. Since the atmosphere bends starlight towards the normal, the apparent position of the star is slightly different from its actual position. The star appears slightly higher (above) than its actual position when viewed near the horizon. Further, this apparent position of the star is not stationary, but keeps on changing slightly. Since the stars are very distant, they approximate point-sized sources of light. As the path of rays of light coming from the star goes on varying slightly, the apparent position of the star fluctuates and the amount of starlight entering the eye flickers - the star sometimes appears brighter, and at some other time, fainter, which gives the twinkling effect. `

        answer: `Answer: D`,
        exp: `Explanation: The sky appears blue during a clear cloudless day because the molecules in the air scatter blue light from the sun more than they scatter red light. Twinkling of stars is caused by the atmospheric refraction of light. Light from the sun near the horizon passes through thicker layers of air and travel larger distance in the earth’s atmosphere before reaching our eyes. Near the horizon, most of the blue light and other lights with shorter wavelengths are scattered away by the particles. Therefore, the light that reaches our eyes is of longer wavelength.

        answer: `Answer: D`,
        exp: `Explanation: A current, which changes direction after equal intervals of time, is called an alternating current while direct current (DC) does not change its direction with time. The difference between the direct and alternating currents is that the direct current always flows in one direction, whereas the  alternating current reverses its direction periodically. Most power stations constructed these days produce alternating current (AC). In India, the AC changes direction after every 1/100 second, that is, the frequency of AC is 50 Hz. An important advantage of AC over DC is that electric power can be transmitted over long distances without much loss of energy `

        answer: `Answer: B`,
        exp: `Explanation: Neoprene (CR), also called polychloroprene or chloroprene rubber, synthetic rubber produced by the polymerization (or linking together of single molecules into giant, multiple-unit molecules) of chloroprene. A good general-purpose rubber, neoprene is valued for its high tensile strength, resilience, oil and flame resistance, and resistance to degradation by oxygen and ozone; however, its high cost limits its use to special-properties applications. This polymer tends to crystallize and harden slowly at temperatures below about 10 °C (50 °F). It also crystallizes on stretching, so cured components are strong even without the addition of fillers such as carbon black. Because the double bond between the carbon atoms is shielded by the pendant atoms and CH2 groups, the molecular interlinking necessary for vulcanizing the polymer to a cured rubber is usually effected through the chlorine atom. The presence of chlorine in the molecular structure causes this elastomer to resist swelling by hydrocarbon oils, to have greater resistance to oxidation and ozone attack, and to possess a measure of flame resistance. Principal applications are in products such as wire and cable insulation, hoses, belts, springs, flexible mounts, gaskets, and adhesives, where resistance to oil, heat, flame, and abrasion are required.`

        answer: `Answer: D`,
        exp: `Explanation: The atmospheric nitrogen cannot be taken directly by plants and animals. Certain bacteria and blue green algae present in the soil fix nitrogen from the atmosphere and convert into compounds of nitrogen. Once nitrogen is converted into these usable compounds, it can be utilised by plants from the soil through their root system. Nitrogen is then used for the synthesis of plant proteins and other compounds. Animals feeding on plants get these proteins and other nitrogen compounds. When plants and animals die, bacteria and fungi,  present in the soil convert the nitrogenous wastes into nitrogenous compounds to be used by plants again. Certain other bacteria convert some part of them to nitrogen gas which goes back into the atmosphere. As a result, the percentage of nitrogen in the atmosphere remains more or less constant.

        answer: `Answer: B`,
        exp: `Explanation: During the development of a thunderstorm, the air currents move upward while the water droplets move downward. These vigorous movements cause separation of charges. By a process, the positive charges collect near the upper edges of the clouds and the negative charges accumulate near the lower edges. There is accumulation of positive charges near the ground also. When the magnitude of the accumulated charges becomes very large, the air which is normally a poor conductor of electricity, is no longer able to resist their flow. Negative and positive charges meet, producing streaks of bright light and sound. We see streaks as lightning . The process of generation of lightning is called electric discharge. This can occur between two or more clouds; or between the clouds and earth. Lightning Conductor is a device used to protect buildings from the effect of lightning. A metallic rod, taller than the building, is installed in the walls of the building during its construction. One end of the rod is kept out in the air and the other is buried deep in the ground.

        answer: `Answer: A`,
        exp: `Explanation: Latent heat, energy absorbed or released by a substance during a change in its physical state (phase) that occurs without changing its temperature. The latent heat associated with melting a solid or freezing a liquid is called the heat of fusion; that associated with vaporizing a liquid or a solid or condensing a vapour is called the heat of vaporization. The latent heat is normally expressed as the amount of heat (in units of joules or calories) per mole or unit mass of the substance undergoing a change of state. Latent heat arises from the work required to overcome the forces that hold together atoms or molecules in a material. The regular structure of a crystalline solid is maintained by forces of attraction among its individual atoms, which oscillate slightly about their average positions in the crystal lattice. As the temperature increases, these motions become increasingly violent until, at the melting point, the attractive forces are no longer sufficient to maintain the stability of the crystal lattice. However, additional heat (the latent heat of fusion) must be added (at constant, temperature) in order to accomplish the transition to the even more-disordered liquid state, in which the individual particles are no longer held in fixed lattice positions but are free to move about through the liquid. A liquid differs from a gas in that the forces of attraction between the particles are still sufficient to maintain a long-range order that endows the liquid with a degree of cohesion. As the temperature further increases, a second transition point (the boiling point) is reached where the long-range order becomes unstable relative to the largely independent motions of the particles in the much larger volume occupied by a vapour or gas. Once again, additional heat (the latent heat of vaporization) must be added to break the long-range order of the liquid and accomplish the transition to the largely disordered gaseous state.`

Cohesion paves the way for surface tension, establishing a solid-like condition where, in low density or light, materials can be set. Cohesion is also known as cohesive force or cohesive attraction. Cohesion promotes attraction between dissimilar molecules. This concept has many applications, the most common being its role in promoting coating strength. The strength in coatings refers to its cohesion measure to a substrate or surface. Without good cohesion, the coating is useless.

However, the amount of copper may range from 55% to 95% by weight, with the amount of zinc varying from 5% to 40%.2 Lead is commonly added to brass at a concentration of around 2%. The lead addition improves the machinability of brass. However, significant lead leaching often occurs, even in brass that contains a relatively low overall concentration of lead. Uses of brass include musical instruments, firearm cartridge casing, radiators, architectural trim, pipes and tubing, screws, and decorative items. Brass Properties: 1. Brass often has a bright gold appearance, however, it can also be reddish-gold or silvery-white. A higher percentage of copper yields a rosy tone, while more zinc makes the alloy appear silver. 2.

        answer: `Answer: B`,
        exp: `Explanation: Barometer, device used to measure atmospheric pressure. Because atmospheric pressure changes with distance above or below sea level, a barometer can also be used to measure altitude. There are two main types of barometers: mercury and aneroid. In the mercury barometer, atmospheric pressure balances a column of mercury, the height of which can be precisely measured. To increase their accuracy, mercury barometers are often corrected for ambient temperature and the local value of gravity. Common pressure units include pounds per square inch; dynes per square centimetre; newtons per square metre (the SI unit called the pascal); inches, centimetres, or millimetres of mercury; and millibars (1 millibar equals 1,000 dynes per square centimetre, 100 pascals, or 0.75 millimetre of mercury). A barometer that mechanically records changes in barometric pressure over time is called a barograph. Though mercury,  barographs have been made, aneroid barographs are much more common.

        exp: `Explaantion: Sublimation is the transition from the solid phase to the gas phase without passing through an intermediate liquid phase. This endothermic phase transition occurs at temperatures and pressures below the triple point. The term "sublimation" only applies to physical changes of state and not to the transformation of a solid into a gas during a chemical reaction. For example, when candle wax undergoes combustion, the,  paraffin is vaporized and reacts with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water. This is not sublimation. The opposite process of sublimation—where a gas undergoes a phase change into solid form—is called deposition or desublimation. Sublimation Examples: 1. Dry ice is solid carbon dioxide. At room temperature and pressure, it sublimates into carbon dioxide vapor. 2. Freezer burn results from the sublimation of ice into water vapor. 3. At the right temperature, the elements iodine and arsenic will sublimate from solid form into gaseous form. 4. Naphthalene, a chemical commonly used in mothballs, readily sublimates at room temperature and pressure. 5. Water ice will sublimate, although more slowly than dry ice.

        exp: `Explanation: A nanometer (also "nanometre") is a unit of measurement used to measure length. One nanometer is one billionth of a meter, so nanometers are certainly not used to measure long distances. Instead, they serve to measure extremely small objects, such as atomic structures or transistors found in modern CPUs. A single nanometer is one million times smaller than a millimeter. If you take one thousandth of a millimeter, you have one micrometer,,  or a single micron. If you divide that micron by 1,000, you have a nanometer. Needless to say, a nanometer is extremely small. Since integrated circuits, such as computer processors, contain microscopic components, nanometers are useful for measuring their size. In fact, different eras of processors are defined in nanometers, in which the number defines the distance between transistors and other components within the CPU. The smaller the number, the more transistors that can be placed within the same area, allowing for faster, more efficient processor designs.`

        exp: `Explanation: The moon completes one rotation on its axis as it completes one revolution around the Earth. the the day of the appearance of the full disc of the moon is called full moon day, but the time period between two consecutive full moons is a little more than 29 days. In many calendars, this is the period of a month. The day on which the whole disc of the moon is visible is known as the full moon day. Thereafter, every night the size of the bright part of the moon appears to become thinner and thinner. On the fifteenth day the moon is not visible. This day is known as the new moon day. The next day, only a small portion of the moon appears in the sky. This is known as the crescent moon. Then again the moon grows larger every day. On the fifteenth day once again we get a full view of the moon. On July 21, 1969 the American astronaut Neil Armstrong landed on the moon for the first time followed by Edwin Aldrin.`

        exp: `Explaantion: Rutherford Atomic Theory: Rutherford, a student of J. J. Thomson modified the atomic structure with the discovery of another subatomic particle called “Nucleus”. His atomic model is based on the Alpha ray scattering experiment. Alpha Ray Scattering Experiment: A. Construction: 1. A very thin gold foil of 1000 atoms thick is taken. 2. Alpha rays (doubly charged Helium He2+) were made to bombard the gold foil. 3. ZnS screen is placed behind the gold foil. B. Observations: 1. Most of the rays just went through the gold foil making scintillations (bright spots) in the ZnS screen. 2. A few rays got reflected after hitting the gold foil. 3. One in 1000 rays got reflected by an angle of 180° (retraced path) after hitting the gold foil. C. Conclusions: 1. Since most rays passed through, Rutherford concluded that most of the space inside the atom is empty. 2. Few rays got reflected because of the repulsion of its positive with some other positive charge inside the atom. 3. 1/1000th of rays got strongly deflected because of a very strong positive charge in the center of the atom he called this strong positive charge as “nucleus”. 4. He said most of the charge and mass of the atom resides in the Nucleus Rutherford’s Structure of Atom: Based on the above observations and conclusions, Rutherford proposed his own atomic structure which is as follows. 1. The nucleus is at the center of an atom, where most of the charge and mass are concentrated. 2. Atomic structure is spherical. 3. Electrons revolve around the nucleus in a circular orbit, similar to the way planets orbit the sun. Limitations of Rutherford Atomic Model: 1. If electrons have to revolve around the nucleus, they will spend energy and that too against the strong force of attraction from the nucleus, a lot of energy will be spent by the electrons and eventually, they will lose all their energy and will fall into the nucleus so the stability of atom is not explained. 2. If electrons continuously revolve around the ‘nucleus, the type of spectrum expected is a continuous spectrum. But in reality, what we see is a line spectrum.`

        answer: `Answer: B`,
        exp: `Explanation: Elements with the same atomic number but a different mass number are defined as “Isotopes”. The number of protons and neutrons combined together is called atomic mass or mass number of an element, whereas the total number of protons gives the atomic number of an element. In a certain element, the number of protons will always remain constant. However, the number of neutrons can change. The number of neutrons varies but the number of protons always remains same in an isotope of a single element. Thus, the definition “Elements with the same atomic number but a different mass number are termed as Isotopes.” For Example: Hydrogen has three most stable isotopic formsprotium, deuterium, as well as tritium. All the three isotopic forms of hydrogen have the same number of protons but vary in the number of neutrons. The number of neutrons in protium is zero, the number of neutrons in deuterium is one and the number of neutrons in tritium is two. Chemical properties: Generally, the chemical properties of isotopes of any element are almost identical. The exception to this case is the isotopes of hydrogen because the numbers of neutrons have a major effect on the size of the nucleus of a hydrogen atom. Physical properties: The physical properties of isotopes in a particular element vary from each other. This is because the physical properties of any isotope depend on the mass. The mass of each isotope of a single element varies from one another. Processes such as fractional distillation and diffusion are used to separate isotopes from one another. We make use of the fact that isotopes have different physical properties. Uses of Isotopes:  Carbon dating makes use of Carbon-14, an isotope of Carbon. This isotope of carbon is present in the atmosphere as radioactive carbon. The amount of carbon-14 obtained in fossils help palaeontologists to calculate the age of the fossils.  Uranium Isotopes are popular for its use in nuclear reactors. U-235 is used as a fuel in nuclear reactors.  Radioactive Isotopes are used for medicinal purposes. They are used for detection of tumours, blood clots, etc. Arsenic-74, An isotope of arsenic, is used for determining the presence of a tumour. Similarly, sodium-24 is used for the detection of blood clots.  Cobalt (cobalt-60) isotope of carbon is applied in cancer treatments.  Iodine (Iodine-131) isotope of carbon helps in the treatment of goitre.`

The number of electrons in orbit is equal to the number of protons in the nucleus (each proton has an an electrical charge of plus one, while each electron has the same charge only negative one). Since all atoms (of all element are electrically neutral), the number of electrons in orbit around the nucleus equals the number of protons in those nuclei, so the electrical charges balance each other. It is the way that these electrons orbit the nucleus (according to definite laws) that determines each element’s chemical properties. See a Periodic Table of the Elements.

        answer: `Answer: B`,
        exp: `Explanation: Thomson atomic model was proposed by William Thomson in the year 1900. This model explained the description of an inner structure of the atom theoretically. It was strongly supported by Sir Joseph Thomson, who had discovered the electron earlier. During cathode ray tube experiment, a negatively charged particle was discovered by J.J. Thomson. This experiment took place in the year 1897. Cathode ray tube is a vacuum tube. The negative particle was called an electron. Thomson assumed that an electron is two thousand times lighter than a proton and believed that an atom is made up of thousands of electrons. In this atomic structure model, he considered atoms surrounded by a cloud having positive as well as negative charges. The demonstration of the ionization of air by X-ray was also done by him together with Rutherford. They were the first to demonstrate it. Thomson’s model of an atom is similar to a plum pudding. Postulates of Thomson’s atomic model: Postulate 1: An atom consists of a positively charged sphere with electrons embedded in it Postulate 2: An atom as a whole is electrically neutral because the negative and positive charges are equal in magnitude Thomson atomic model is compared to watermelon. Where he considered:  Watermelon seeds as negatively charged particles  The red part of the watermelon as positively charged Limitations of Thomson’s atomic model:  It failed to explain the stability of an atom because his model of atom failed to explain how a positive charge holds the negatively charged electrons in an atom. Therefore, This theory also failed to account for the position of the nucleus in an atom  Thomson’s model failed to explain the scattering of alpha particles by thin metal foils  No experimental evidence in its support.`

Note that Avogadro's number, on its own, is a dimensionless quantity. In chemistry and physics, Avogadro's number usually refers to a number of atoms, molecules, or ions, but it can be applied to any "particle." For example, 6.02 x 1023 elephants are the number of elephants in one mole of them! Atoms, molecules, and ions are much less massive than elephants, so there needed to be a large number to refer to a uniform quantity of them so that they could be compared relative to each other in chemical equations and reactions.`

        ],
        answer: `Answer: B`,
        exp: `Explanation: Angiosperms are the largest group of plants on Earth. There are approximately 270,000 known species alive today. There's probably one nearby right now. Angiosperms include all plants that have flowers and account for approximately 80% of all known living plants. Example of an angiosperm: Carpel of Broomrape plant Characteristics: Angiosperms are able to grow in a variety of habitats. They can grow as trees, shrubs, bushes, herbs, and small flowering plants. Some of the characteristics of angiosperms include: 1. All angiosperms have flowers at some stage in their life. The flowers serve as the reproductive organs for the plant, providing them a means of exchanging genetic information. 2. Angiosperms have small pollen grains that spread genetic information from flower to flower. These grains are much smaller than the gametophytes, or reproductive cells, used by non-flowering plants. This small size allows the process of fertilization to occur quicker in the flowers of angiosperms and makes them more efficient at reproducing. 3. All angiosperms have stamens. Stamens are the reproductive structures found in flowers that produce the pollen grains that carry the male genetic information. 4. Angiosperms have much smaller female reproductive parts than non-flowering plants, allowing them to produce seeds more quickly. 5. Angiosperms have carpels that enclose developing seeds that may turn into a fruit. 6. A great advantage for angiosperms is the production of endosperm. Endosperm is a material that forms after fertilization and serves as a highly nutritional food source for the developing seed and seedling. `

        answer: `Answer: C`,
        exp: `Explanation: 1. The average velocity of an object is its total displacement divided by the total time taken. In other words, it is the rate at which an object changes its position from one place to another. Average velocity is a Vector quantity. The SI unit is meters per second. 2. The distance travelled is the path taken by a body to get from an initial point to an end point in a given period of time, at a certain velocity. If the velocity is constant: Distance = time * velocity. 3. The average speed of an object is the total distance traveled by the object divided by the elapsed time to cover that distance. It's a scalar quantity which means it is defined only by magnitude. A related concept, average velocity, is a vector quantity. A vector quantity is defined by magnitude and direction. 4. If an object moves relative to a reference frame—for example, if a professor moves to the right relative to a whiteboard, or a passenger moves toward the rear of an airplane—then the object’s position changes. This change in position is known as displacement. The word displacement implies that an object has moved, or has been displaced. Displacement is defined to be the change in position of an object. `

Force can be classified into two categories: contact force such as frictional force and non-contact force such as gravitational force. According to Newton, when two bodies interact, they exerted force on each other and these forces are known as action and reaction pair which is explained in Newton’s third law of motion. Newton’s third law of motion states that: When one body exerts a force on the other body, the first body experiences a force which is equal in magnitude in the opposite direction of the force which is exerted. The above statement means that in every interaction, there is a pair of forces acting on the interacting objects. The magnitude of the forces are equal and the direction of the force on the first object is opposite to the direction of the force on the second object.,  `

        answer: `Answer: A`,
        exp: `Explanation: Sir Isaac Newton published three laws in the 17th century. In this article, we are going to talk about Newton’s 1st law. This law does an introduction of motion of the object and the force acting on it. In other words, it deals with the motion of an object and its relation to force. Newton’s first law states that: a body remains in the state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line unless and until an external force acts on it.,  Putting Newton’s 1st law of motion in simple words, a body will not start moving until and unless an external force acts on it. Once it is set in motion, it will not stop or change its velocity until and unless some force acts upon it once more. The first law of motion is sometimes also known as the law of inertia. There are two conditions on which the 1st law of motion is dependent: 1. Objects at rest: When an object is at rest velocity (v= 0) and acceleration (a = 0) are zero. Therefore, the object continues to be at rest. 2. Objects in motion: When an object is in motion, velocity is not equal to zero (v ≠ 0) while acceleration (a = 0) is equal to zero. Therefore, the object will continue to be in motion with constant velocity and in the same direction. What is an External Force: An external force is defined as the change in the mechanical energy that is either the kinetic energy or the potential energy in an object. These forces are caused by external agents. Examples of external forces are friction, normal force and air resistance. `

Hence, specific gravity is the ratio of the mass of a substance to that of a reference substance, let’s consider the density of honey is approx. 1.42 grams/cm3, so its specific gravity would be 1.42/1 = 1.42. Notice that specific gravity is a ratio, therefore specific gravity does not have a unit, and hence specific gravity is a dimensionless physical quantity. The specific gravity of a substance will let us know if it will float or sink, it gives us the idea about relative mass or relative density. If,  the specific gravity of a substance is below 1 then it will float and if it is greater than 1 it will sink. Relative density is the ratio of density of a substance to the density of a given reference material. Thus, it is a unit less quantity.`

        exp: `Explanation: Osmosis is the diffusion of a solvent through a differentially permeable membrane. In biological systems, the solvent will usually be water. Osmosis will occur whenever the water concentrations are different on either side of a differentially permeable membrane. Osmosis can be defined as the movement of water molecules from a higher water concentration area to the area of less water concentration through a semipermeable membrane. In other words, it can be defined as the diffusion of water molecules through a semipermeable membrane. It is a special case of diffusion of water (High to low). For example, water in the roots of plants is transported through osmosis. Significance of Osmosis:  Osmosis influences the transport of nutrients and the release of metabolic waste products.  It is responsible for the absorption of water from the soil and conducting it to the upper parts of the plant through the xylem.  It stabilizes the internal environment of a living organism by maintaining the balance between water and intercellular fluid levels.  It maintains the turgidity of cells.  It is a process by which plants maintain their water content despite the constant water loss due to transpiration.  This process controls the cell to cell diffusion of water.  Osmosis induces cell turgor which regulates the movement of plants and plant parts.  Osmosis also controls the dehiscence of fruits and sporangia.  Higher osmotic pressure protects the plants against drought injury.`

Our body is made up of cells of different shapes and sizes.Cells are the lowest level of organisation in every life form. From organism to organism, the count of cells may vary. Humans have the number of cells compared to that of bacteria.Cells comprise several cell organelles that perform specialised functions to carry out life processes. Every organelle has a specific structure. The hereditary material of the organisms is also present in the cells. Robert Hooke discovered the cell in 1665. Robert Hooke observed a piece of bottle cork under a compound microscope and noticed minuscule structures that reminded him of small rooms. Consequently, he named these “rooms” as cells. However, his compound microscope had limited magnification, and hence, he could not see any details in the structure. Because of this limitation, Hooke concluded that these were non-living entities. Later Anton Van Leeuwenhoek observed cells under another compound microscope with higher magnification. This time, he had noted that the cells exhibited some form of movement (motility). As a result, Leeuwenhoek concluded that these microscopic entities were “alive.” Eventually, after a host of other observations, these entities were named as animalcules. In 1883, Robert Brown, a Scottish botanist, provided the very first insights into the cell structure. He was able to describe the nucleus present in the cells of orchids. Characteristics of Cells: Following are the various essential characteristics of cells:  Cells provide structure and support to the body of an organism.  The cell interior is organised into different individual organelles surrounded by a separate membrane.  The nucleus(major organelle) holds genetic information necessary for reproduction and cell growth.  Every cell has one nucleus and membrane-bound organelles in the cytoplasm.  Mitochondria, a double membrane-bound organelle is mainly responsible for the energy transactions vital for the survival of the cell.  Lysosomes digest unwanted materials in the cell.  Endoplasmic reticulum plays a significant role in the internal organisation of the cell by synthesising selective molecules and processing, directing and sorting them to their appropriate locations.`

The term was coined by Christian de Duve, a Belgian biologist, who discovered it and ultimately got a Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology in the year 1974. Lysosome Definition: “Lysosomes are sphere-shaped sacs filled with hydrolytic enzymes that have the capability to break down many types of biomolecules.” In other words, lysosomes are membranous organelles whose specific function is to breakdown cellular wastes and debris by engulfing it with hydrolytic enzymes. Lysosomes work as the waste discarding structures of the cell by processing undesirable materials and degrading them, both from the exterior of the cell and waste constituents inside the cell. But sometimes, the digestive enzymes may end up damaging the lysosomes themselves, and this can cause the cell to die. This is termed as autolysis, where “auto” means “self” and “lysis” means “the disintegration of the cell by the destruction of its cell membrane“. Hence, lysosomes are known as “Suicidal Bags” of the cell.`

        ],
        answer: `Answer: B`,
        exp: `Explanation: A. Leprosy Definition “Leprosy is a chronic infection that affects the skin, mucous membrane, and nerves, and causes discolouration, lumps, disfigurement and deformities in skin.” What is Leprosy? Leprosy is a disease that causes severe, scarring skin sores and nerve damage in the limbs. Leprosy disease has affected people on every continent. Leprosy is actually not that infectious but it spreads when a healthy person comes in regular and close contact with mouse droplets and leprosy patient. Children get more affected by this disease than adults. Almost, 180000 people all over the world get infected with leprosy. The Leprosy disease mainly affects the peripheral nerves, skin, upper respiratory tract and the eyes. The most prevalent possibility of transmission is through the respiratory route. Leprosy is also transmitted through insects. B. What is AIDS? AIDS or Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome is a syndrome caused by the HIV virus. In this condition, a person’s immune system becomes too weak to fight off any kind of infection or disease. AIDS is usually the last stage of HIV infection; a stage where the body can no longer defend itself and thus spawns various diseases. AIDS, when untreated, leads to death. AIDS is an advanced HIV infection or late-stage HIV. Someone with AIDS may develop a wide range of health conditions like - pneumonia, thrush, fungal infections, TB, toxoplasmosis and cytomegalovirus. There is also an increased risk of developing a medical illness like cancer and brain illnesses. CD4 count refers to the number of Thelper cells in a cubic millilitre of blood. A person may be referred to as “AIDS-affected” when the CD4 count drops below 200 cells per cubic millilitre of blood. C. What is Malaria? Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease caused by various species of the parasitic protozoan microorganisms called Plasmodium. Malaria is a disease that man has battled with for a long time. The first evidence of this protozoan came from mosquitoes preserved in amber nearly 30 million years ago. It is even thought to have brought the Roman Empire to its knees. Malaria was so prevalent during the Roman times that the disease is also called ‘Roman Fever’. Today, the credit for actually discovering the parasite is given to Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran, a French physician. He even won the Nobel Prize in 1907 for his findings. Malaria parasite exists in the form of a motile sporozoite. The vector of malaria i.e. the female Anopheles mosquito transmits the malarial sporozoites into the hosts. When an infected mosquito bites a human, the sporozoites are injected into the blood through the mosquito’s saliva. The sporozoites travel into our body and accumulate in the liver. These parasites initially multiply within the liver, by damaging the liver and rupturing the blood cells in the body. Malaria kills by causing the destruction of the red blood cells in the host. The parasites reproduce asexually in the RBCs, bursting the cells and releasing more parasites to infect more cells. The rupture of red blood cells by the malaria parasite releases a toxin called hemozoin which causes the patient to experience a condition known as the chills. When the female Anopheles mosquito bites an infected human, the parasites enter the mosquito’s body along the human blood it is drinking. It is inside the mosquito’s body that the actual development and maturing of the parasite happens. The parasites produced in the human body reach the intestine of the mosquito where the male and females cells fertilize each other to lead to the formation of a sporozoite. On maturing, the sporozoite breaks out the mosquito’s intestine and migrate to the salivary glands. Once they reach salivary glands, they wait till the mosquito bites another human and the process of infection and disease begins all over again. It is prudent however to observe that the complete development of the malaria parasite takes place in two different hosts; humans and mosquitoes. D. What is Common Cold? Cold or common cold is a disease diagnosed with a headache, runny nose, scratchy throat, fever and non stop sneezing. It is a viral infectious disease of the upper respiratory tract which primarily affects the nose and sometimes sinuses, ears, and bronchial tubes. A common cold is caused by viruses. Some of them include -  Rhinovirus - This one usually intrudes your system during early fall, spring, and summer. They are behind 10%-40% of colds. Even though these are the main common viruses which affect you, they would rarely make you seriously sick.  Coronavirus - The virus affects the human system during winter and early spring. This virus is behind 20% of colds. There are more than 30 types of coronavirus, out of which only 3 or 4 ones are harmful.  RSV and parainfluenza - These tiny organisms are behind severe infections like pneumonia, in young children. `

The major symptoms of this disease are characterized by high fever, loss of appetite and diarrhoea. Salmonella typhi is the bacterium responsible for this disease and humans are the only carriers. The first case of typhoid fever was reported in the United States in the early 1900’s. Overall, about 21 million people are infected with this disease annually, and about 200,000 cases are fatal. Furthermore, scientists have identified 2 types of typhoid causing bacterium, namely: 1. ST1 2. ST2 Causes Of Typhoid: Also called as “Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi”, this microbe is the causative agent for this disease. It is a gram-negative bacteria characterized by a thin cell wall and an outer membrane. The cells are reddish in colour, with some having black stains in the centre. It is rod-shaped and grows in the small intestine of the human body. Human beings are only the main hosts of this bacteria. This type of species can survive in environments which are rich in oxygen and also, they are found in sewage, water bodies and some eventually make their own on to food. The bacteria enter the human body through the contaminated foods and water, where it then enters into the intestinal cells of the human body. Later, it passes through the bloodstream and destroys the lymphatic system and spreads throughout the body. This bacterium is mainly carried by the white blood cells present in the liver and also the bone marrow. There, they multiply and re-enter the blood cells, which in turn, causes a number of symptoms to appear in the later stages. `

        answer: `Answer: A`,
        exp: `Explanation: A vaccine is a preparation that improves immunity to a particular disease. It is a biological prepared product which contains typical agents resembling a microorganism that causes disease, made from weakened or dead forms of the microbes, one of its surface proteins or its toxins. It helps in the stimulation of the immune system and to identify the invaded microbes as the foreign agent and destroy it so that the immune system can be recognized and destroy any microorganism encountered later. A vaccine is an antigenic substance that develops immunity against a disease which can be delivered through needle injections or by mouth or by aerosol.Vaccination is the injection of a dead or weakened organism that forms immunity against that organism in the body.Immunization is the process by which an animal or a person stays protected from diseases. Vaccines are Safe and Effective: Vaccines are the perfect defense against a preventable and contagious disease that can be deadly. Vaccines are one of the safest medical products available but there are some preventive measures one should adopt. Precise information of the values of vaccines along with their possible side-effects assist people to take decisions on vaccines. How Well Do Vaccines Work? No medicine can be labeled as perfect but most of the vaccines produce immunity for about 90-100% of the cases. Certainly, better sanitation and hygiene can help prevent the spread of disease but the germs that are responsible still stay around. The germs continue to make people sick as long as their existence. Every vaccine has to be licensed by the Food and Drug Administration abbreviated by FDA before being brought into use in the United States. A vaccine needs to go through extensive tests to confirm that it is safe before the approval of FDA. Among these tests are the clinical tests trials that compare groups of people who get a control such as a placebo with the group of people who get a vaccine. A vaccine is approved only when FDA confirms that it is safe for intended use. Vaccines save millions of lives every year. When a particular section of a city or town is immunized against a communicable disease, several members of the same community are shielded against the diseases as the opportunity for an outbreak is minimum. The principle of immunity refers to the control of various contagious diseases that involve rabies, mumps, influenza, measles and pneumococcal disease. `

        answer: `Answer: D`,
        exp: `Explanation: The term potential energy was introduced by the 19thcentury Scottish engineer and physicist William Rankine. There are several types of potential energy, each associated with a distinct type of force. It is the energy by virtue of an object’s position relative to other objects. We can define potential energy as: The energy held by an object because of its position relative to other objects, stresses within itself, its electric charge, or other factors. Similarly, in the case of a spring, when it is displaced from its equilibrium position, it gains some amount of energy which we observe in the form of stress we feel in our hand upon stretching it. We can define potential energy as a form of energy that results from the alteration of its position or state. Potential Energy Formula: The formula for potential energy depends on the force acting on the two objects. For the gravitational force the formula is: W = m×g×h = mgh,  Where, m is the mass in kilograms g is the acceleration due to gravity h is the height in meters Unit: Gravitational potential energy has the same units as kinetic energy: kg m2 / s2 Note: All energy has the same units - kg m2 / s2, and is measured using the unit Joule (J). `

        answer: `Answer: C`,
        exp: `Explanation: A force must be applied on a body to accelerate an object. Work must be done in order to apply a force. The body will move with an unvarying speed after the work has been done due to the energy provided by it. The speed and the mass of the body are factors on which the energy transfer that makes up the kinetic energy depends.,  The kinetic energy of an object is the energy that it possesses due to its motion. Kinetic energy definition is given as: The energy of an object because of its motion or the energy gained by an object from its state of rest to motion. Formula of Kinetic Energy: Following is the formula of kinetic energy: KE=12mv2 Where, KE is the kinetic energy of the object m is the mass of an object v is the velocity of an object Kinetic energy is an example of scalar quantity which means that the quantity has only magnitude and no direction.

        ],
        answer: `Answer: C`,
        exp: `Explanation: Power is always dependent on work done, so if a person does work at different rates his power also differs at different times. This is where the concept of average-power comes into the picture. What is Power? We can define power as the rate of doing work, it is the work done in unit time. The SI unit of power is Watt (W) which is joules per second (J/s). Sometimes the power of motor vehicles and other,  machines are given in terms of Horsepower (hp), which is approximately equal to 745.7 watts. What is Average Power? We can define average power as the total energy consumed divided by the total time taken. In simple language, we can say that average power is the average amount of work done or energy converted per unit of time. Power Formula: Power is defined as the rate at which work is done upon an object. Power is a time-based quantity. which is related to how fast a job is done. The formula for power is mentioned below. Power = Work / time P = W / t Unit of Power: The unit for standard metric work is the Joule and the standard metric unit for time is the second, so the standard metric unit for power is a Joule / second, defined as a Watt and abbreviated W.`

            'D. heat flows from the blood to skin ',
        ],
        answer: `Answer: A`,
        exp: `Explanation: If you rub your hands together for several seconds, you'll notice that your hands feel warm. That warmth is caused by a force called friction. When objects like your hands come in contact and move against each other, they produce friction. Friction is defined as: The resistance offered by the surfaces that are in contact with each other when they move over each other. Friction works in the opposite direction in which the body is moving making the body slow down. Friction is useful in most of the cases. Friction is also dependent on the external factors. Factors Affecting Friction: Following are the two factors on which friction depends 1. On the nature of the two surfaces that are in contact: Friction is dependent on the smoothness or roughness of the two surfaces that are in contact with each other. When the surface is smooth, the friction between the two reduces as there is no much interlocking of irregularities taking place. While the surface is rough, friction increases. 2. On the force that is acting on these surfaces: When force is applied along with the irregularities, friction increases.,  What Causes Friction? When we see any object, we can see the smooth surface but when the same object is viewed under a microscope, it can seen that even the smooth appearing object has rough edges. Tiny hills and grooves can be seen through the microscope and they are known as irregularities of the surface. So, when one object is moved over the other, these irregularities on the surface get entangled giving rise to friction. More the roughness, more will the irregularities and greater will be the force applied. `

You have learned about various forms of energy - heat, electrical, chemical, nuclear, etc. In this article, we will learn about the laws and principles that govern energy. This law is known as the law of conservation of energy. What is the Law of Conservation of Energy? The law of conservation of energy states that energy can neither be created nor be destroyed. Although, it may be transformed from one form to another. If you take all forms of energy into account, the total energy of an isolated system always remains constant. All the forms of energy follow the law of conservation of energy. In brief, the law of conservation of energy states that: In a closed system, i.e., a system that is isolated from its surroundings, the total energy of the system is conserved. Law of Conservation of Energy Examples: In physics, most of the inventions rely on the fact that energy is conserved when it is transferred from one form to another. A,  number of electrical and mechanical devices operate solely on the law of conservation of energy. We will discuss a few examples here.  In a torch, the chemical energy of the batteries is converted into electrical energy, which is converted into light and heat energy.  In hydroelectric power plants, waterfalls on the turbines from a height. This, in turn, rotates the turbines and generates electricity. Hence, the potential energy of water is converted into the kinetic energy of the turbine, which is further converted into electrical energy.  In a loudspeaker, electrical energy is converted into sound energy.  In a microphone, sound energy is converted into electrical energy.  In a generator, mechanical energy is converted into electrical energy.  When fuels are burnt, chemical energy is converted into heat and light energy.  Chemical energy from food is converted to thermal energy when it is broken down in the body and is used to keep it warm. `

It is released in the chemical reaction and mostly produces heat as a by-product, known as an exothermic reaction. The examples of stored chemical energy are biomass, batteries, natural gas, petroleum, and coal. Mostly, when the chemical energy is released from a substance, it is transformed into a new substance completely. For instance, when an explosion goes off, the chemical energy in it is transferred to the surroundings as thermal energy, kinetic energy, and sound energy. Chemical Energy in Everyday Life:  We know that plants need solar energy to produce sugar from carbon dioxide to water. Sugar, water and carbon dioxide stay together by chemical bonds that hold the chemicals together.,   For instance, all sugars consist of oxygen, carbon and hydrogen atoms held together by chemical bonds. These atoms do not connect together automatically; rather some energy is required to make them stay together.  Plants use solar energy to put the hydrogen, the carbon and the oxygen atoms as a whole in the form of sugar. This is a suitable example of energy transformation where energy is transformed from one form to another. Here, solar energy is transformed into chemical energy and prevents from falling apart. `

    Explanation: Sound waves travel through a medium by alternately contracting and expanding the parts of the medium in which it travels. The speed of sound is the distance travelled per unit time by any sound. In the next section few sections, let us learn to determine the speed of sound in various medium. What is Speed of Sound? The speed of sound is defined as the dynamic propagation of sound waves. This depends on the characteristics of the medium through which the propagation takes place. Speed of sound is used for describing the speed of sound waves in an elastic medium. Speed of Sound Formula The formula for speed of sound is given with respect to gases. It is the square root of product of coefficient of adiabatic expansion and pressure of the gas divided by the density of the medium. The mathematical representation is given as: What is the Speed of Sound in Air? The speed of sound is an essential parameter used in a variety of field in Physics. The speed of sound refers to the distance travelled per unit time by a sound wave propagating through a medium. The speed of sound in air at 20oC is 343.2 m/s which translates to 1,236 km/h. The speed of sound in gases is proportional to the square root of the absolute temperature (measured in Kelvin) but it is independent of the frequency of the sound wave or the pressure and the density of the medium. But none of the gases we find in real life are ideal gases and this causes the properties to slightly change. Speed of Sound in Solid, Liquid and Gases Sound can travel through wood too! In fact, sound likes travelling through solid more. In the olden days, doctors used stethoscopes consisting of thin wooden rods with broadened ends and they worked exactly like our modern ones and performed just as well. How can sound travel through solids? Speed of Sound in Solid Sound is nothing more than a disturbance which is propagated by the collisions between the particles; one molecule hitting the next and so forth. Solids are significantly denser than liquids or gases. This means that the molecules are closer to each other in solids than in liquids and in liquids than in gases. This closeness due to density means that they can collide very quickly. Effectively it takes less time for a molecule of a solid to bump into its neighbouring molecule. Due to this advantage, the speed of sound in a solid is larger than in a gas. Speed of Sound in Liquid Similarly, the density of a liquid is greater than the density of a gas. Therefore the distances between molecules are more in liquids than in solids but are less than in gases. Hence the speed of sound in liquids lies in between the speed of sound in solids and gases. Speed of Sound in Gas We should remember that the speed of sound is independent of the density of the medium when it enters a liquid or solid. Since gases expand to fill the given space, density is quite uniform irrespective of the type of gas. This clearly isn't the case with solids and liquids.

        ],
        answer: `Answer: D`,
        exp: `Explanation: A sound is a form of energy, just like electricity, heat or light. Let’s examine some sources of sounds like a bell. When you strike a bell, it makes a loud ringing noise. Now, instead of just listening to the bell, put your finger on the bell after you have struck it. Can you feel it vibrating? This is the key to the sound. It is even more evident in guitars and drums. You can see the wires vibrating every time you pluck it. When the bell or the guitar stops vibrating, the sound also stops. The to and fro motion of the body is termed as Vibration. You can see examples of vibrations everywhere. Vibrating objects produce sound. Some vibrations are visible, some aren’t. If you pull and then release a stretched rubber band, the band moves to and fro about the central axis and while doing so it also produces a sound. The sound moves through a medium by alternately contracting and expanding parts of the medium it is travelling through. In physics, Sound is a vibration that propagates as an acoustic wave, through a transmission medium such as a gas, liquid or solid. Sound is pictorially represented by a continuous succession of peaks and valleys. The distance between two consecutive peaks or trough is termed as the wavelength of the wave or the period. The number of cycles per unit time is termed as the frequency of the sound. Frequency is measured in cycles per second or Hertz. The faster an object vibrates, i.e. the higher the frequency, then the higher the pitch of the sound. The difference between a man’s voice and women must be clearly evident to you. The voice of a man has a lower frequency which contributes to the deepness of the bass in the voice. Women, in contrast, have a voice with higher frequency resulting in a higher shrillness or pitch. What Is Longitudinal Wave? Longitudinal waves are the waves where the displacement of the medium is in the same direction, or in opposite direction, and direction of the travel of the wave. The distance between the centers of two consecutive regions of compression or the rarefaction is defined by wavelength, λ. When the compression and rarefaction regions are of two waves coincide with each other, it is known as constructive interference and if the regions of compression and rarefaction do not coincide, it is known as destructive interference. Sound Waves: A sound wave is an example of a longitudinal wave and is produced by the vibrating motion of the particles that travel through a conductive medium. The example of sound waves in a longitudinal direction is tuning fork. In Sound waves, the amplitude of the wave is the difference between the maximum pressure caused by the wave and the pressure of the undisturbed air. The propagation speed of sound depends upon the type, composition of the medium and temperature through which it propagates. `

        exp: `Explanation: What is Ultrasound? Sound waves with frequencies higher than the upper audible limit of human hearing are called ultrasound. The limit varies from person to person but is approximately 20,000 Hertz. The physical properties of ultrasound are similar to the normal audible sound. This type of scientific concept is used in many different fields such as navigation, medicine, imaging, cleaning, mixing, communication, testing etc. Even in nature, bats and porpoises use this particular technique for the location of prey and obstacles. In the following section, we shall learn about its applications. Applications: 1. Cleaning: In objects with parts that are difficult to reach, for example, spiral tubes and electronic components, the process of ultrasonic cleaning is used. Here, the object is dipped in a solution of suitable cleaning material and ultrasonic waves are passed into it. As a result of this, high-frequency waves are generated that cause the dirt and grease to detach from the surface. 2. Detection of cracks: Ultrasound is used to detect cracks in the metallic components that are used in the construction of high rise structures such as buildings and bridges. They generate and display an ultrasonic waveform that is interpreted by a trained operator, often with the aid of analysis software, to locate and categorize flaws in test pieces. High-frequency sound waves reflect from flaws in predictable ways, producing distinctive echo patterns that can be displayed and recorded by portable instruments. A trained operator identifies specific echo patterns corresponding to the echo response from good parts and from representative flaws. The echo pattern from a test piece may then be compared to the patterns from these calibration standards to determine its condition. 3. Echocardiography: In the process of electrocardiography, the ultrasonic waves are used to form an image of the heart using reflection and detection of these waves from various parts. 4. Ultrasonography: ,Medical ultrasound is a diagnostic imaging technique based on it. It is used for the imaging of internal body structures such as muscles, joints and internal organs. Ultrasonic images are known as sonograms. In this process, pulses of ultrasound are sent to the tissue using a probe. The sound echoes off the tissue, where different tissues reflect sound varying in degrees. These echoes are recorded and displayed an image. 5. Lithotripsy: Ultrasonic waves are used to break stones in the kidney. High energy sound waves are passed through the body without injuring it and break the stone into small pieces. These small pieces move through the urinary tract and out of the body more easily than a large stone. 6. SONAR: SONAR, Sound Navigation, and Ranging is a technique in which sound waves are used to navigate, detect and communicate under the surface of the water. 7. Echolocation: Echolocation is the process where sound waves and echoes are used to determine objects in space. Echolocation is used by bats to navigate and find their food in the dark. Bats send out sound waves from their mouth and nose, which then hit the objects in their vicinity producing echoes, which are then received by the bats. The nature of the echo helps them determine the size, the shape and the distance of the object. `

        answer: `Answer: C`,
        exp: `Explanation: When a metal is attacked by substances around it such as moisture, acids, etc., it is said to be corroded and this process is called corrosion. The black coating on silver and the green coating on copper are examples of corrosion. Corrosion causes damage to car bodies, bridges, iron railings, ships and to all objects made up of metals, especially those of iron. When fats and oils are oxidised, they become rancid and their smell and taste change. Usually substances which prevent oxidation (antioxidants) are added to foods containing fats and oil. Keeping food in air tight containers helps to slow down oxidation. Due to this reason, bags of chips are flushed with gas such as nitrogen to prevent the chips from getting oxidised. `

            'D. A change in temperature of the water bodies ',
        ],
        answer: `Answer: C`,
        exp: `Explanation: Various Causes of Water Pollution 1. Industrial waste: Industries produce a huge amount of waste which contains toxic chemicals and pollutants which can cause air pollution and damage to us and our environment. They contain pollutants such as lead, mercury, sulfur, asbestos, nitrates, and many other harmful chemicals. Many industries do not have a proper waste management system and drain the waste in the fresh water which goes into rivers, canals and later into the sea. The toxic chemicals have the capability to change the color of water, increase the number of minerals, also known as eutrophication, change the temperature of water and pose a serious hazard to water organisms. 2. Sewage and wastewater: The sewage and wastewater that is produced by each household is chemically treated and released into the sea with fresh water. The sewage water carries harmful bacteria and chemicals that can cause serious health problems. Pathogens are known as a common water pollutant; The sewers of cities house several pathogens and thereby diseases. Microorganisms in water are known to be causes of some very deadly diseases and become the breeding grounds for other creatures that act as carriers. These carriers inflict these diseases via various forms of contact onto an individual. A very common example of this process would be Malaria. 3. Mining activities: Mining is the process of crushing the rock and extracting coal and other minerals from underground. These elements when extracted in the raw form contains harmful chemicals and can increase the number of toxic elements when mixed up with water which may result in health problems. Mining activities emit a large amount of metal waste and sulphides from the rocks which is harmful to the water. 4. Marine dumping: The garbage produced by each household in the form of paper, aluminum, rubber, glass, plastic, food is collected and deposited into the sea in some countries. These items take from 2 weeks to 200 years to decompose. When such items enter the sea, they not only cause water pollution but also harm animals in the sea. 5. Accidental oil leakage: Oil spill poses a huge concern as a large amount of oil enters into the sea and does not dissolve with water; thereby opens problem for local marine wildlife such as fish, birds and sea otters. For e.g.: a ship carrying a large quantity of oil may spill oil if met with an accident and can cause varying damage to species in the ocean depending on the quantity of oil spill, size of the ocean, the toxicity of pollutant. 6. The burning of fossil fuels: Fossil fuels like coal and oil when burnt produce a substantial amount of ash in the atmosphere. The particles which contain toxic chemicals when mixed with water vapor result in acid rain. Also, carbon dioxide is released from the burning of fossil fuels which result in global warming. 7. Chemical fertilizers and pesticides: Chemical fertilizers and pesticides are used by farmers to protect crops from insects and bacterias. They are useful for the plant’s growth. However, when these chemicals are mixed up with water produce harmful for plants and animals. Also, when it rains, the chemicals mix up with rainwater and flow down into rivers and canals which pose serious damages for aquatic animals. 8. Leakage from sewer lines: A small leakage from the sewer lines can contaminate the underground water and make it unfit for the people to drink. Also, when not repaired on time, the leaking water can come on to the surface and become a breeding ground for insects and mosquitoes. 9. Global warming: An increase in earth’s temperature due to the greenhouse effect results in global warming. It increases the water temperature and results in the death of aquatic animals and marine species which later results in water pollution. 10. Radioactive waste: Nuclear energy is produced using nuclear fission or fusion. The element that is used in the production of nuclear energy is Uranium which is a highly toxic chemical. The nuclear waste that is produced by radioactive material needs to be disposed of to prevent any nuclear accident. Nuclear waste can have serious environmental hazards if not disposed of properly. Few major accidents have already taken place in Russia and Japan. 11. Urban development: As the population has grown, so has the demand for housing, food, and cloth. As more cities and towns are developed, they have resulted in increasing use of fertilizers to produce more food, soil erosion due to deforestation, increase in construction activities, inadequate sewer collection, and treatment, landfills as more garbage is produced, increase in chemicals from industries to produce more materials. 12. Leakage from the landfills: Landfills are nothing but a huge pile of garbage that produces the awful smell and can be seen across the city. When it rains, the landfills may leak and the leaking landfills can pollute the underground water with a large variety of contaminants. 13. Animal waste: The waste produced by animals is washed away into the rivers when it rains. It gets mixed up with other harmful chemicals and causes various water-borne diseases like cholera, diarrhea, jaundice, dysentery and typhoid. 14. Underground storage leakage: Transportation of coal and other petroleum products through underground pipes is well known. Accidentals leakage may happen anytime and may cause damage to the environment and result in soil erosion. `

        ],
        answer: `Answer: D`,
        exp: `Explanation: To understand ozone layer, it would be helpful to know the different layers of the atmosphere. The earth’s atmosphere is composed of many layers, each playing a significant role. The first layer stretching approximately 10 kilometers upwards from the earth’s surface is known as the troposphere. A lot of human activities such as gas balloons, mountain climbing, and small aircraft flights take place within this region. The stratosphere is the next layer above the troposphere stretching approximately 15 to 60 kilometers. The ozone layer sits in the lower region of the stratosphere from about 20-30 kilometers above the surface of the earth. The thickness of the ozone layer is about 3 to 5 mm, but it pretty much fluctuates depending on the season and geography. Ozone layer is a deep layer in earth’s atmosphere that contain ozone which is a naturally occurring molecule containing three oxygen atoms. These ozone molecules form a gaseous layer in the Earth’s upper atmosphere called stratosphere. This lower region of stratosphere containing relatively higher concentration of ozone is called Ozonosphere. The Ozonosphere is found 15-35 km (9 to 22 miles) above the surface of the earth. The concentration of ozone in the ozone layer is usually under 10 parts per million while the average concentration of ozone in the atmosphere is about 0.3 parts per million. The thickness of the ozone layer differs as per season and geography. The highest concentrations of ozone occur at altitudes from 26 to 28 km (16 to 17 miles) in the tropics and from 12 to 20 km (7 to 12 miles) towards the poles. Why Ozone Layer is Necessary? An essential property of ozone molecule is its ability to block solar radiations of wavelengths less than 290 nanometers from reaching Earth’s surface. In this process, it also absorbs ultraviolet radiations that are dangerous for most living beings. UV radiation could injure or kill life on Earth. Though the absorption of UV radiations warms the stratosphere but it is important for life to flourish on planet Earth. Research scientists have anticipated disruption of susceptible terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems due to depletion of ozone layer. Ultraviolet radiation could destroy the organic matter. Plants and plankton cannot thrive, both acts as food for land and sea animals, respectively. For humans, excessive exposure to ultraviolet radiation leads to higher risks of cancer (especially skin cancer) and cataracts. It is calculated that every 1 percent decrease in ozone layer results in a 2-5 percent increase in the occurrence of skin cancer. Other ill-effects of the reduction of protective ozone layer include - increase in the incidence of cataracts, sunburns and suppression of the immune system. Causes of Ozone Layer Depletion: Credible scientific studies have substantiated that the cause of ozone layer depletion is human activity, specifically, human-made chemicals that contain chlorine or bromine. These chemicals are widely known as ODS, an acronym for Ozone-Depleting Substances. The scientists have observed reduction in stratospheric ozone since early 1970’s. It is found to be more prominent in Polar Regions. Ozone-Depleting Substances have been proven to be eco-friendly, very stable and non-toxic in the atmosphere below. This is why they have gained popularity over the years. However, their stability comes at a price; they are able to float and remain static high up in the stratosphere. When up there, ODS are comfortably broken down by the strong UV light and the resultant chemical is chlorine and bromine. Chlorine and bromine are known to deplete the ozone layer at supersonic speeds. They do this by simply stripping off an atom from the ozone molecule. One chlorine molecule has the capability to break down thousands of ozone molecules. Ozone-depleting substances have stayed and will continue to stay in the atmosphere for many years. This, essentially, implies that a lot of the ozone-depleting substances human have allowed to go into the atmosphere for the previous 90 years are still on their journey to the atmosphere, which is why they will contribute to ozone depletion. The chief ozone-depleting substances include chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), carbon tetrachloride, hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and methyl chloroform. Halons, sometimes known as brominated fluorocarbons, also contribute mightily to ozone depletion. However, their application is greatly restricted since they are utilized in specific fire extinguishers. The downside to halons is they are so potent that they are able to deplete the ozone layer 10 times more than ozone-depleting substances. Scientists in this age are working around the clock to develop Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) to take the place of hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) for use in vehicle air conditioning. Hydrochlorofluorocarbons are powerful greenhouse gases, but they are not able to deplete ozone. Chlorofluorocarbons, on the other hand, significantly contribute to climate change, which means Hydrofluorocarbons continue to be the better alternative until safer alternatives are available. There are two regions in which the ozone layer has depleted.  In the mid-latitude, for example, over Australia, ozone layer is thinned. This has led to an increase in the UV radiation reaching the earth. It is estimated that about 5-9% thickness of the ozone layer has decreased, increasing the risk of humans to over-exposure to UV radiation owing to outdoor lifestyle.  In atmospheric regions over Antarctica, ozone layer is significantly thinned, especially in spring season. This has led to the formation of what is called ‘ozone hole’. Ozone holes refer to the regions of severely reduced ozone layers. Usually ozone holes form over the Poles during the onset of spring seasons. One of the largest such hole appears annually over Antarctica between September and November. `

        answer: `Answer: A`,
        exp: `Explanation: Nitrogen fixation is the essential biological process and the initial stage of the nitrogen cycle. In this process, nitrogen in the atmosphere is converted into ammonia (another form of nitrogen) by certain bacterial species like Rhizobium, Azotobacter, etc. and by other natural phenomena. Plants are the main of the sources of food. The nutrients obtained from plants are synthesized by plants using various elements which they obtain from the atmosphere as well as from the soil. This group of elements includes nitrogen as well. Plants obtain nitrogen from the soil through the process of protein synthesis. Unlike carbon dioxide and oxygen, atmospheric nitrogen cannot be obtained through stomata of leaves. Because the concentration of nitrogen gas present in the atmosphere can not be directly used by plants and also the concentration of the usable form of nitrogen in the atmosphere is very less. There are certain bacteria and some natural phenomenon which help in Nitrogen fixation. `

The role these nutrients play in plant growth is complex, and this document provides only a brief outline. Major elements: 1. Nitrogen (N) Nitrogen is a key element in plant growth. It is found in all plant cells, in plant proteins and hormones, and in chlorophyll. Atmospheric nitrogen is a source of soil nitrogen. Some plants such as legumes fix atmospheric nitrogen in their roots; otherwise fertiliser factories use nitrogen from the air to make ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate and urea. When applied to soil, nitrogen is converted to mineral form, nitrate, so that plants can take it up. Soils high in organic matter such as chocolate soils are generally higher in nitrogen than podzolic soils. Nitrate is easily leached out of soil by heavy rain, resulting in soil acidification. You need to apply nitrogen in small amounts often so that plants use all of it, or in organic form such as composted manure, so that leaching is reduced. 2. Phosphorus (P) Phosphorus helps transfer energy from sunlight to plants, stimulates early root and plant growth, and hastens maturity. Very few Australian soils have enough phosphorus for sustained crop and pasture production and the North Coast is no exception. The most common phosphorus source on the North Coast is superphosphate, made from rock phosphate and sulfuric acid. All manures contain phosphorus; manure from grain-fed animals is a particularly rich source. 3. Potassium (K) Potassium increases vigour and disease resistance of plants, helps form and move starches, sugars and oils in plants, and can improve fruit quality. Potassium is low or deficient on many of the sandier soils of the North Coast. Also, heavy potassium removal can occur on soils used for intensive grazing and intensive horticultural crops (such as bananas and custard apples). 4. Calcium (Ca) Calcium is essential for root health, growth of new roots and root hairs, and the development of leaves. It is generally in short supply in the North Coast's acid soils. Lime, gypsum, dolomite and superphosphate (a mixture of calcium phosphate and calcium sulfate) all supply calcium. Lime is the cheapest and most suitable option for the North Coast; dolomite is useful for magnesium and calcium deficiencies, but if used over a long period will unbalance the calcium/magnesium ratio. Superphosphate is useful where calcium and phosphorus are needed. 5. Magnesium (Mg) Magnesium is a key component of chlorophyll, the green colouring material of plants, and is vital for photosynthesis (the conversion of the sun's energy to food for the plant). Deficiencies occur mainly on sandy acid soils in high rainfall areas, especially if used for intensive horticulture or dairying. Heavy applications of potassium in fertilisers can also produce magnesium deficiency, so banana growers need to watch magnesium levels because bananas are big potassium users. Magnesium deficiency can be overcome with dolomite (a mixed magnesium-calcium carbonate), magnesite (magnesium oxide) or epsom salts (magnesium sulfate). 6. Sulfur (S) Sulfur is a constituent of amino acids in plant proteins and is involved in energy-producing processes in plants. It is responsible for many flavour and odour compounds in plants such as the aroma of onions and cabbage. Sulfur deficiency is not a problem in soils high in organic matter, but it leaches easily. On the North Coast seaspray is a major source of atmospheric sulfur. Superphosphate, gypsum, elemental sulfur and sulfate of ammonia are the main fertiliser sources. `

        question: `395. Which of the following is a food-fodder mixed farming system? `,
        options: [
            'A. Growing food crops alone ',
            'B. Growing fodder crops alone ',
            'C. Growing crops which can be used as food and fodder by using more fertilizers. ',
            'D. Growing food crops and fodder crops in the same field. ',
        ],
        answer: `Answer: D`,
        exp: `Explanation: Mixed farming system can be defined as - (i).The use of a single farm for multiple purposes, as the growing of cash crops or the raising of livestock is called as mixed farming. (ii).Farming involving both the growing of crops and the keeping of livestock is called as mixed farming. (iii). A type of commercial agriculture concerned with the production of both crops and animals on one farm. Stock on a mixed farm used to be grazed on fallow land, but many modern mixed farms produce some, or all, of their fodder crops. Mixed farming is a system of farming in which a farmer conducts different types of agricultural practices together, on a single farm in view of increasing his income through different sources, is called as mixed farming. But, what is a farm? & what is Farming? Receiving the radiant energy of sun through crops and cattle is called as farming whereas, the place where these practices are done, is called as a farm. Here is one example: Rearing of cattle and growing fodder for them on a piece of land is called as farming. In other words, Mixed farming is the combining of two independent agricultural enterprises on the same farm. In mixed farming a farmer can take up different types of practices for income generation while doing his main business of agriculture. Some of these practices that can be done together with the main agricultural practices are - poultry faming, dairy farming, bee keeping, sericulture, Pisciculture, shrimp farming, goat and sheep rearing, piggery and agro forestry. Thus a farmer can raise his income manifold through carrying out different farming practices together. The greatest benefit from this type of farming is that if any one business does not pay desired benefit, the same can be recovered from the benefit of the other business. Merits of Mixed Farming System: The mixed farming system is the largest category of livestock system in the world which covers about 2.5 billion hectares of land, of which 1.1 billion hectares are arable rainfed crop land, 0.2 billion hectares are irrigated cropland and 1.2 billion hectares are grassland. This system of farming produces 92% of the world’s milk supply. Some of the important merits of mixed farming are mentioned below. 1. This farming system maintains soil fertility by recycling soil nutrients and allowing the introduction and use of rotations between various crops and forage legumes and trees, or for land to remain fallow and grasses and shrubs to become reestablished; 2. Mixed farming maintains soil biodiversity, minimize soil erosion, help to conserve water and provide suitable habitats for birds; 3. It makes the best use of crop residues. When they are not used as feed, stalks may be incorporated directly into the soil, where, for some time, they act as a nitrogen trap, exacerbating deficiencies. In the tropical semi-arid areas, termite action results in loss of nutrients before the next cropping season. Burning, the other alternative, increases carbon dioxide emissions; and 4. Mixed farming allows intensified farming, with less dependence on natural resources and preserving more biodiversity than would be the case if food demands were to be met by crop and livestock activities undertaken in isolation. There are a number of methods that are adopted in the mixed farming system. Some of these methods are being described below 1. Food -Fodder Farming In this method of mixed farming, the fodder crops are also grown along with other crops. Farmers can grow Sorghum, Pusa Giant Napier; berseem etc. as fodder crops for their cattle alongwith food crops. It is through this system that the availability of high variety of fodder is ensured for milch cattle while growing crops for production of grains, pulses, vegetables, oil and fruits etc. 2. Agroforestry System According to the World Forestry Centre (ICRAF) 1993, - “Agroforestry system is a collective name forthe land use systems and practices in which woody perennial plants are deliberately integrated with crops (and some times animals) on the same land management unit. The integration can be either in a spatial mixture or in a temporal sequence. There are normally both ecological and economic interactions between woody and non-woody components in Agroforestry". Again in the year 2003, the ICRAF further defined the agroforestry system as - a dynamic, ecology based, natural resources management system that, through the integration of trees on farms and in the agricultural landscape, diversifies and sustains production for increased social, economic and environmental benefits for land users at all levels (World Agroforestry Centre, 2003). `

            'C. Trapping and capturing fish from sea coast ',
            'D. Extraction of oil from fishes ',
        ],
        answer: `Answer: A`,
        exp: `Explanation: Inland fisheries are any activity conducted to extract fish and other aquatic organisms from "inland waters". The term "inland waters" is used to refer to lakes, rivers, brooks, streams, ponds, inland canals, dams, and other land-locked (usually freshwater) waters (such as the Caspian Sea, Aral Sea, etc.). Whilst most inland waters are freshwater( i.e. zero salinity), there are many areas that are classified nationally as inland waters which have daily or seasonal fluctuations in salinity (e.g. estuaries, deltas, some coastal lagoons). Some areas are permanently brackishwater (coastal lagoons, the Caspian Sea, Lake Van) or even hypersaline (e.g. The Utah Great Salt Lake). Fisheries in inland waters have long provided an important source of food for mankind. The global population now stands at 7.6 billion and is projected to rise to 9.7 billion people by 2050. Inland capture fisheries have an important role to play in the global challenge to sustainably feed this growing population, as they deliver quality nutrition to some of the world’s most vulnerable populations in a manner that is both accessible and affordable. Inland fisheries are critical for a group of developing countries in the world, providing an important source of nutrition, food security as well as micronutrients. These nutritional and food security benefits are an integral part of the agricultural landscape of these countries, thus inland fisheries are closely linked to food production, water and land management, biodiversity and ecosystems. Inland fisheries are also increasingly impacted and changed as countries develop their water and land resources for agriculture. They are under increasing pressure and threats arising from far reaching changes to the aquatic environment arising from human activities such as damming, navigation, wetland reclamation for agriculture, urbanization, water extraction and transfer, and waste disposal. `

        ],
        answer: `Answer: C`,
        exp: `Explanation: Principles of crop rotation The basic principles of crop rotations are as follows:  Deep rooted crops should be succeeded by shallow rooted crop s such as cotton, castor, pigeon peapotato, lentil, green gram etc.  Dicot crops should be rotated by monocot crops such as mustar d, potato- rice, wheat- sugarcane.  Leguminous crops should be succeeded by nonleguminous crops and vice versa (green gram- wheat).  Exhaustive crops should be succeeded with restorative crops s uch as potato, sorghum, sugarcane, castor- sunhemp, black gra m, cowpea.  Grain crops should be followed by foliage crops such as, wheatdhaincha, black gram.  Long duration crops should be succeeded by short duration cro ps such as sugarcane, napier, Lucerne- cowpea, black gram, grou nd nut.  Crops susceptible to soil borne pathogens and parasitic weeds s hould be followed by tolerant trap crops such as sugarcane- ma rigold, mustard (for nematodes); tobacco- rice, pulses (for oro banche); pearl millet- castor (for striga); lucern, berseem- oats (for cuscuta).  Crops with problematic weeds should be followed by clean crop s/ multi cut crops and other dissimilar crops such as wheat- pu ddle rice for Phalaris minor; berseem- potato for Chicorium int ybus; rice- vegetables for Echinochloa crusgalli.  Heavy irrigation and intensive labour requiring crops should be followed by less water and labour requiring crops such as sugar cane, paddy- mungbean and sesame. Advantages of crop rotation Following are the advantages of an appropriate crop rotation:  Higher yield without incurring extra investment.  Enhance soil fertility and microbial activity.  Avoid accumulation of toxic substances.  The legumes in a cropping system, assimilating nitrogen from th e atmosphere and enriching the soil with their root system.  Better utilization of nutrients and soil moisture.  Insurance against natural devastation.  Maintain soil health by avoiding insect pest, diseases and weed problems.  Provide proper labour, power and capital distribution throughou t the year.  Higher chances to provide diversified commodities.  Slow but steady income, which is beneficial to marginal and sma ll farmers.  Deep rooted crops work the soil below plough layer. `
