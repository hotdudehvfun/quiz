            `D. Act of 1892`,        ],
        answer: `Answer: B`,
        exp: `Explanation - Answer is B. Features of the India Act of 1919 1. It relaxed the central control over the provinces by demarcating and separating the central and provincial subjects. The central and provincial legislatures were authorised to make laws on their respective list of subjects. However, the structure of government continued to be centralised and unitary. 2. It further divided the provincial subjects into two parts— transferred and reserved. The transferred subjects were to be administered by the governor with the aid of ministers responsible to the legislative Council. The reserved subjects, on the other hand, were to be administered by the governor and his executive council without being responsible to the legislative Council. This dual scheme of governance was known as ‘dyarchy’—a term derived from the Greek word di-arche which means double rule. However, this experiment was largely unsuccessful. 3. It introduced, for the first time, bicameralism and direct elections in the country. Thus, the Indian Legislative Council was replaced by a bicameral legislature consisting of an Upper House (Council of State) and a Lower House (Legislative Assembly). The majority of members of both the Houses were chosen by direct election. 4. It required that the three of the six members of the Viceroy’s executive Council (other than the commander-in-chief) were to be Indian. 5.

It created a new office of the High Commissioner for India in London and transferred to him some of the functions hitherto performed by the Secretary of State for India. 8. It provided for the establishment of a public service commission. Hence, a Central Public Service Commission was set up in 1926 for recruiting civil servants. 9. It separated, for the first time, provincial budgets from the Central budget and authorised the provincial legislatures to enact their budgets. 10. It provided for the appointment of a statutory commission to inquire into and report on its working after ten years of its coming into force`

The Indian brand of socialism is a 'democratic socialism' and not a communistic socialism (also known as 'state socialism') which involves the nationalisation of all means of production and distribution and the abolition of private property. Democratic socialism, on the other hand, holds faith in a 'mixed economy' where both public and private sectors co-exist side by side. As the Supreme Court says, 'Democratic socialism aims to end poverty, ignorance, disease and inequality of opportunity'. Indian socialism is a blend of Marxism and Gandhism, leaning heavily towards Gandhian socialism. The new economic policy (1991) of liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation has, however, diluted the socialist credentials of the Indian State`

A democratic polity can be classified into two categories-monarchy and republic. In a monarchy, the head of the state (usually king or queen) enjoys a hereditary position, that is, he comes into office through succession, eg, Britain. In a republic, on the other hand, the head of the state is always elected directly or indirectly for a fixed period, eg, USA. Therefore, the term 'republic' in our Preamble indicates that India has an elected head called the president. He is elected indirectly for a fixed period of five years. A republic also means two more things: one, vesting of political sovereignty in the people and not in a single individual like a king; second, the absence of any privileged class and hence all public offices being opened to every citizen without any discrimination`

            ` D. Parliament assumes the power to legislate on subject in the state list. `,
        ],
        answer: `Answer: D`,
        exp: ` Explanation - Answer is D The President acquires the following powers when the President’s Rule is imposed in a state - 1. He can take up the functions of the state government and powers vested in the governor or any other executive authority in the state. 2. He can declare that the powers of the state legislature are to be exercised by the Parliament. 3. He can take all other necessary steps including the suspension of the constitutional provisions relating to anybody or authority in the state. The President dismisses the state council of ministers headed by the chief minister. The state governor, on behalf of the President, carries on the state administration with the help of the chief secretary of the state or the advisors appointed by the President. This is the reason why a proclamation under Article 356 is popularly known as the imposition of ‘President’s Rule’ in a state. Further, the President either suspends or dissolves the state legislative assembly. In case of dissolution fresh elections are held for the state assembly. The Parliament passes the state legislative bills and the state budget. When the state legislature is thus suspended or dissolved - 1. The Parliament can delegate the power to make laws for the state to the President or to any other authority specified by him in this regard. 2. The Parliament or in case of delegation, the President or any other specified authority can make laws conferring powers and imposing duties on the Centre or its officers and authorities, the President can authorize, when the Lok Sabha is not in session, expenditure from the state consolidated fund pending its sanction by the Parliament. 3. The President can promulgate, when the Parliament is not in session, ordinances for the governance of the state. A law made by the Parliament or president or any other specified authority continues to be operative even after the President’s Rule. This means that the period for which such a law remains in force is not co-terminus with the duration of the proclamation. But it can be repealed or altered or re-enacted by the state legislature. It should be noted here that the President cannot assume to himself the powers vested in the concerned state high court or suspend the provisions of the Constitution relating to it. In other words, the constitutional position, status, powers and functions of the concerned state high court remain same even during the President’s Rule. `

            ` C. Both 1 and 2 `,
            ` D. Neither 1 nor 2 `,
        ],
        answer: `Answer: C`,
        exp: ` Explanation - Answer is C. Effect on the Life of the Lok Sabha and State Assembly - While a proclamation of National Emergency is in operation, the life of the Lok Sabha may be extended beyond its normal term (five years) by a law of Parliament for one year at a time (for any length of time). However, this extension cannot continue beyond a period of six months after the emergency has ceased to operate. For example, the term of the Fifth Lok Sabha (1971-1977) was extended two times by one year at a time. Similarly, the Parliament may extend the normal tenure of a state legislative assembly (five years) by one year each time (for any length of time) during a national emergency. This is subject to a maximum period of six months after the Emergency has ceased to operate. Effect on the Fundamental Rights - Articles 358 and 359 describe the effect of a National Emergency on the Fundamental Rights. Article 358 deals with the suspension of the Fundamental Rights guaranteed by Article 19. Article 359 deals with the suspension of other Fundamental Rights (except those guaranteed by Articles 20 and 21). According to Article 358, when a proclamation of national emergency is made, the six Fundamental Rights under Article 19 are automatically suspended. No separate order for their suspension is required. While a proclamation of national emergency is in operation, the state is freed from the restrictions imposed by Article 19. In other words, the state can make any law or can take any executive action abridging or taking away the six Fundamental Rights guaranteed by Article 19. Any such law or executive action cannot be challenged on the ground that they are inconsistent with the six Fundamental Rights guaranteed by Article 19. When the National Emergency ceases to operate,Article 19 automatically revives and comes into force. Any law made during Emergency, to the extent of inconsistency with Article 19, ceases to have effect. However, no remedy lies for anything done during the Emergency even after the Emergency expires. This means that the legislative and executive actions taken during the emergency cannot be challenged even after the Emergency ceases to operate. The 44th Amendment Act of 1978 restricted the scope of Article 358 in two ways - Firstly, the six Fundamental Rights under Article 19 can be suspended only when the National Emergency is declared on the ground of war or external aggression and not on the ground of armed rebellion. Secondly, only those laws which are related with the Emergency are protected from being challenged and not other laws. Also, the executive action taken only under such a law is protected. `

        ],

        answer: `Answer: C`,
        exp: ` Explanation - Answer is C. Article 360 empowers the president to proclaima Financial Emergency if he is satisfied that a situation has arisen due to which the financial stability or credit of India or any part of its territory is threatened. The 38th Amendment Act of 1975 made the satisfaction of the president in declaring a Financial Emergency final and conclusive and not questionable in any court on any ground. But, this provision was subsequently deleted by the 44thAmendment Act of 1978 implying that the satisfaction of the president is not beyond judicial review. A proclamation declaring financial emergency must be approved by both the Houses of Parliament within two months from the date of its issue. However, if the proclamation of Financial Emergency is issued at a time when the Lok Sabha has been dissolved or the dissolution of the Lok Sabha takes place during the period of two months without approving the proclamation, then the proclamation survives until 30 days from the first sitting of the Lok Sabha after its reconstitution, provided the Rajya Sabha has in the meantime approved it. Once approved by both the Houses of Parliament, the Financial Emergency continues indefinitely till it is revoked. This implies two things - (a) There is no maximum period prescribed for its operation; and (b) Repeated parliamentary approval is not required for its continuation. A resolution approving the proclamation of financial emergency can be passed by either House of Parliament only by a simple majority, that is, a majority of the members of that house present and voting. A proclamation of Financial Emergency may be revoked by the president at any time by a subsequent proclamation. Such a proclamation does not require the parliamentary approval. `

        answer: `Answer: C`,
        exp: ` Explanation - Answer is C. The Sarkaria Commission on Centre-State Relations (1983–87) recommended establishment of a permanent Inter-State Council under Article 263 of the Constitution. It recommended that in order to differentiate the Inter-State Council from other bodies established under the same Article 263, it must be called as the Inter-Governmental Council. The Commission recommended that the Council should be charged with the duties laid down in clauses (b) and (c) of Article 263. In pursuance, the Janata Dal Government headed by V. P. Singh established the Inter-State Council in 1990. It consists of the following members - 1. Prime minister as the Chairman. 2. Chief ministers of all the states. 3. Chief ministers of union territories having legislative assemblies. 4. Administrators of union territories not having legislative assemblies. 5. Governors of States under President’s rule. 6. Six Central cabinet ministers, including the home minister, to be nominated by the Prime Minister. 7. Five Ministers of Cabinet rank / Minister of State (independent charge) nominated by the Chairman of the Council (i.e., Prime Minister) are permanent invitees to the Council. The council is a recommendatory body on issues relating to inter-state, Centre-state and Centre-union territories relations. It aims at promoting coordination between them by examining, discussing and deliberating on such issues. Its duties are - investigating and discussing such subjects in which the states or the center have a common interest; making recommendations upon any such subject for the better coordination of policy and action on it; and deliberating upon such other matters of general interest to the states as may be referred to it by the chairman. The Council may meet at least thrice in a year. Its meetings are held in camera and all questions are decided by consensus. There is also a Standing Committee of the Council. It was set up in 1996 for continuous consultation and processing of matters for the consideration of the Council. It consists of the following members - 1. Union Home Minister as the Chairman. 2. Five Union Cabinet Ministers. 3. Nine Chief Ministers. The Council is assisted by a secretariat called the Inter-State Council Secretariat. This secretariat was set-up in 1991 and is headed by a secretary to the Government of India. Since 2011, it is also functioning as the secretariat of the Zonal Councils. `

            ` D. All of the above `,
        ],
        answer: `Answer: D`,
        exp: ` Explanation - Answer is D. Article 263 contemplates the establishment of an Inter-State Council to effect co-ordination between the states and between Centre and states. The President can establish such a council if at any time, it appears to him that the public interest would be served by its establishment. He can define the nature of duties to be performed by such a council and its organization and procedure. Even though the president is empowered to define the duties of an inter-state council, Article 263 specifies the duties that can be assigned to it in the following manner - (a) enquiring into and advising upon disputes which may arise between states; (b) investigating and discussing subjects in which the states or the Centre and the states have a common interest; and (c) making recommendations upon any such subject, and particularly for the better co-ordination of policy and action on it. The council’s function to enquire and advice upon inter-state disputes is complementary to the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction under Article 131 to decide a legal controversy between the governments. The Council can deal with any controversy whether legal or non-legal, but its function is advisory unlike that of the court which gives a binding decision. Under the above provisions of Article 263, the president has established the following councils to make recommendations for the better coordination of policy and action in the related subjects (a) Central Council of Health. (b) Central Council of Local Government and Urban Development. (c) Four Regional Councils for Sales Tax for the Northern, Eastern, Western and Southern Zones. The Central Council of Indian Medicine and the Central Council of Homoeopathy were set up under the Acts of Parliament. `

Though the Constitution has adopted the system of proportional representation in the case of Rajya Sabha, it has not preferred the same system in the case of Lok Sabha. Instead, it has adopted the system of territorial representation for the election of members to the Lok Sabha. Under territorial representation, every member of the legislature represents a geographical area known as a constituency. From each constituency, only one representative is elected. Hence such a constituency is known as single-member constituency. In this system, a candidate who secures majority of votes is declared elected. This simple majority system of representation does not represent the whole electorate. In other words, it does not secure due representation to minorities (small groups). The system of proportional representation aims at removing the defects of territorial representation. Under this system, all sections of the people get representation in proportion to their number. `

About: Article 137 of the Constitution gives Supreme Court the power to review any of its judgments or orders. The court has the power to review its rulings to correct a “patent error” and not “minor mistakes of inconsequential import”. Grounds for review petition: In a 2013 ruling, the Supreme Court itself laid down three grounds for seeking a review of a verdict it has delivered — the discovery of new and important matter or evidence which was not within the knowledge of the petitioner or could not be produced by him; mistake or error apparent on the face of the record; or any other sufficient reason which means a reason that is analogous to the other two grounds. Who can file a review petition? It is not necessary that only parties to a case can seek a review of the judgment on it. Any person aggrieved by a ruling can seek a review. Time frame: As per 1996 rules framed by the Supreme Court, a review petition must be filed within 30 days of the date of judgment or order. While a judgment is the final decision in a case, an order is an interim ruling that is subject to its final verdict. `

The specific recommendations of the committee are: Establishment of a 3-tier Panchayati Raj system - Gram Panchayat at the village level, Panchayat Samiti at the block level, and District Parishad at the district level. These tiers should be organically linked through a device of indirect elections. The main purpose of this division is to simplify and to decrease the work load of the state and central government[MSD]. The village Panchayat should be constituted with directly elected representatives, whereas the Panchayat Samiti and Zilla Parishad should be constituted with indirectly elected members. This is because Panchyat is similar to that of state assembly where there is place for politics where as Samiti and Zilla Parishad members should be more educated and knowledgeable and may not need the majority support. All planning and developmental activities should be entrusted to these bodies. The Panchayat Samiti should be the executive body while the Zilla Parishad should be the advisory, coordinating and supervisory body. The District Collector should be the Chairman of the Zilla Parishad. There should be a genuine transfer of power and responsibility to these democratic bodies. Sufficient resources should be transferred to these bodies to enable them to discharge their functions and fulfil their responsibilities. A system should be evolved to effect further devolution of authority in future. `

A district should be the first point for decentralisation under popular supervision below the state level. Zila Parishad should be the executive body and made responsible for planning at the district level. There should be an official participation of political parties at all levels of Panchayat elections. The Panchayat Raj institutions should have compulsory powers of taxation to mobilise their own financial resources. There should be a regular social audit by a district level agency and by a committee of legislators to check whether the funds allotted for the vulnerable social and economic groups are actually spent on them. The state government should not supersede the Panchayat Raj institutions. In case of an imperative supersession, election should be held within 6 months from the date of supersession. The Nyaya Panchayats should be kept as separate bodies from that of development Panchayats. They should be presided over by a qualified judge. The Chief Electoral Officer of the state in consultation with the Chief Election Commissioner should organise and conduct the Panchayati Raj elections. Development functions should be transferred to the Zila Parishad and all development staff should work under its control and supervision. The voluntary agencies should play an important role in mobilising the support of the people for Panchayati Raj. A minister for Panchayati Raj should be appointed in the state council of ministers to look after the affairs of the Panchayati Raj institutions. Seats for SCs and Sts should be reserved on the basis of their population.[1][failed verification] A Constitutional recognition should be accorded to the Panchayati Raj institutions.

Rao Committee - Planning commission in 1985 appointed The Committee on Administrative Arrangement for Rural Development and Poverty Alleviation Programmes under the chairmanship of G. V. K. Rao. The Committee came to conclusion that bureaucratization of development administration opposed to the democratization has weakened the Panchayati Raj institutions. This has resulted in what is aptly called as ‘grass without roots’. The recommendations to strengthen and revitalize the Panchayati Raj system made were - 1. The district level body, Zila Parishad, should be primary in the plan of democratic decentralization. 2. It stated that “the district is the proper unit for planning and development and the Zila Parishad should become the principal body for management of all development programs which can be handled at that level.” 3. The Panchayati Raj institutions at the district and lower levels must be assigned an important role with respect to planning, implementation and monitoring of rural development programs. 4. For effective decentralized district planning, some of the planning functions at the state level should be transferred to the district level planning units. 5. District Development Commissioner post must be created. 6. He would be the chief executive officer of the Zila Parishad. 7. He should be in charge of all development departments at the district level. 8. Regular elections to the Panchayati Raj institutions. Thus, the committee assigned a primary role to the Panchayati Raj in local planning and development. It is in this respect that the recommendations of the G. V. K. Rao Committee Report (1986) were different from those of the Dantwala Committee Report on Block-Level Planning (1978) and the Hanumantha Rao Committee Report on District Planning (1984). Both the committees suggested that the basic decentralised planning function should be done at the district level. `

        answer: `Answer: C`,
        exp: `Explanation - Answer is 3. The role of CAG in the auditing of public corporations is limited.

(ii) Some other corporations are audited by privatenprofessional auditors who are appointed by the Central Government in consultation with the CAG. If necessary, the CAG can conduct supplementary audit. The examples are, Central Warehousing Corporation, Industrial Finance Corporation, and others. (iii) Some other corporations are totally subjected to private audit. In other words, their audit is done exclusively by private professional auditors and the CAG does not come into the picture at all. They submit their annual reports and accounts directly to the Parliament. Examples of such corporations are Life Insurance Corporation of India, Reserve Bank of India, State Bank of India, Food Corporation of India, and others.   `,

            `D. Neither of them `,
        ],
        answer: `Answer: C`,
        exp: `Explanation - Answer is C. Article 76 provides for the office of the Attorney General for India who is the highest law officer in the country. Appointment and Term of the Attorney General - The Attorney General (AG) is appointed by the President.  He must be a person who is qualified to be appointed a judge of the Supreme Court. That means, he must be a citizen of India and he must have been a judge of some High Court for five years or an advocate of some High Court for ten years or an eminent jurist, in the opinion of the President. The term of office of the AG is not fixed by the Constitution. Also, the Constitution does not contain the procedure and grounds for his removal. He holds office during the pleasure of the President. Thus, he may be removed by the President at any time. He may also quit his office by submitting his resignation to the President.  Conventionally, he resigns when the government (Council of Ministers) resigns or is replaced. This is because he is appointed on the government’s advice. The remuneration of the AG is not fixed by the constitution and receives such remuneration as the President may decide. Solicitor General of India - Apart from AG, there are other law officers of the Government of India. They are the solicitor general of India and additional solicitor general of India. They assist the AG in the fulfilment of his official responsibilities. Only the office of the AG is created by the constitution.  Article 76 does not mention about the solicitor general and additional solicitor general. The AG is not a member of the central cabinet. There is a separate law minister in the central cabinet to look after legal matters at the government level.   `,

            `D. Neither 1 nor 2 `,
        ],
        answer: `Answer: B`,
        exp: `Explanation - Answer is B. Role of CAG - CAG makes sure that executive are responsible to the Parliament in the area of financial administration. CAG undertakes audit of expenditure on behalf of the Parliament and hence is an agent of Parliament. CAG is responsible only to the Parliament. Along with legal and regulatory audit, CAG can also conduct propriety audit.  Propriety Audit is seeing that government expenditure follows ‘wisdom, faithfulness and economy’. If not, CAG can comment on the wastage and extravagance of such expenditure. While legal and regulatory audit is mandatory for CAG, the propriety audit is discretionary. CAG cannot ask for details of secret service expenditure. He has to just accept a certificate from administrative authority which says that the said expenditure has been incurred. The Constitution of India sees CAG to be Comptroller as well as Auditor General. But the CAG has no control over the issue of money from the consolidated fund and many departments are authorised to draw money by issuing cheques without specific authority from the CAG, who is  concerned only at the audit stage when the expenditure has already taken place. Thus he is just Auditor General and not a Comptroller. But CAG of Britain has both powers of being Comptroller as well as Auditor General.   `,

            `D. All of the above `,
        ],
        answer: `Answer: A`,
        exp: `Explanation - Answer is A. The functions of the Parliament are varied, complex and voluminous. It has neither the adequate time nor necessary expertise to make a detailed scrutiny of all legislative measures and other matters. Hence, it is assisted by a number of committees in the discharge of its duties.  The Constitution of India mentions these committees, but without any specific provisions regarding their composition, tenure, functions etc. All these matters are dealt by the rules of two Houses. Accordingly, a parliamentary committee means a committee that - A. Is appointed or elected by the House or nominated by the Speaker/Chairman 1. B. Works under the direction of the Speaker/Chairman. C. Presents its report to the House or to the Speaker/Chairman. D. Has a secretariat provided by the Lok Sabha/Rajya Sabha.  The consultative committees, which also consist of members of Parliament, are not parliamentary committees as they do not fulfill above four conditions. A Minister is not eligible for election or nomination to the Financial Committees, Departmental Standing Committees, Committees on Empowerment of Women, Government Assurances, Petitions, Subordinate Legislation and Welfare of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. Broadly, Parliamentary Committees are of 2 types - Standing Committees and Ad Hoc Committees. Standing Committees are permanent (constituted every year or periodically) and work on a continuous basis.  Ad hoc Committees are temporary and cease to exist on completion of the task assigned to them. Standing Committees - On basis of the nature of functions, standing committees can be classified into six categories - 1. Financial Committees - A. Public Accounts Committee. B. Estimates Committee. C. Committee on Public Undertakings. 2. Departmental Standing Committees (24 in number). 3. Committees to Inquire -  A. Committee on Petitions. B. Committee of Privileges. C. Ethics Committee. 4. Committees to Scrutinize and Control- A. Committee on Government Assurances. B. Committee on Subordinate Legislation. C. Committee on Papers Laid on the Table. D. Committee on Welfare of SCs and Sts. (e) Committee on Empowerment of Women. (f) Joint Committee on Offices of Profit.  5. Committees Relating to the Day-to-Day Business of the House - A. Business Advisory Committee. B. Committee on Private Members’ Bills and Resolutions. C. Rules Committee. D. Committee on Absence of Members from Sittings of the House. 6. House-Keeping Committees or Service Committees (i.e., Committees concerned with the Provision of Facilities and Services to Members) - A. General Purposes Committee. B. House Committee. C. Library Committee.  D. Joint Committee on Salaries and Allowances of Members.   `,

            `D. Neither 1 nor 2 `,
        ],
        answer: `Answer: B`,
        exp: `Explanation - Answer is B. Consultative committees are attached to various ministries/departments of the Central Government.  They consist of members of both the Houses of Parliament. The Minister/Minister of State in charge of the Ministry concerned acts as the chairman of the consultative committee of that ministry. These committees provide a forum for informal discussions between the ministers and the members of Parliament on policies and programmes of the government and the manner of their implementation. These committees are constituted by the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs. The guidelines regarding the composition, functions and procedures of these committees are formulated by this Ministry.  The Ministry also makes arrangements for holding their meetings both during the session and the intersession period of Parliament. The membership of these committees is voluntary and is left to the choice of the members and the leaders of their parties. The maximum membership of a committee is 30 and the minimum is 10. These committees are normally constituted after the new Lok Sabha is constituted, after General Elections for the Lok Sabha. Thus, these committees shall stand dissolved upon dissolution of every Lok Sabha and shall be reconstituted upon constitution of each Lok Sabha.  Also, separate Informal Consultative Committees of the members of Parliament are also constituted for all the Railway Zones. Members of Parliament belonging to the area falling under a particular Railway Zone are nominated on the Informal Consultative Committee of that Railway Zone. Unlike the Consultative Committees attached to various ministries/departments, the meetings of the Informal Consultative Committees are to be arranged during the session periods only.   `,

            `D. Neither 1 nor 2 `,
        ],
        answer: `Answer: C`,
        exp: `Explanation - Answer is C. This committee was created in 1964 on the recommendation of the Krishna Menon Committee. Originally, it had 15 members (10 from the Lok Sabha and 5 from the Rajya Sabha). In1974, its membership was raised to 22 (15 from the Lok Sabha and 7 from the Rajya Sabha).  The members of this committee are elected by the Parliament every year from amongst its own members according to the principle of proportional representation by means of a single transferable vote. Thus,all parties get due representation in it. The term of office of the members is one year. A minister cannot be elected as a member of the committee. The chairman of the committee is appointed by the Speaker from amongst its members who are drawn from the Lok Sabha only.  Thus, the members of the committee who are from the Rajya Sabha cannot be appointed as the chairman. Functions - 1. To examine the reports and accounts of public undertakings. 2. To examine the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General on public undertakings. 3. To examine (in the context of autonomy and efficiency of public undertakings) whether the affairs of the public undertakings are being managed in accordance with sound business principles and prudent commercial practices. 4. To exercise such other functions vested in the public accounts committee and the Estimates Committee in relation to public undertakings which are allotted to it by the Speaker from time-totime.  The committee cannot examine and investigate - 1. Matters of major government policy as distinct from business or commercial functions of the public undertakings. 2. Matters of day-to-day administration. 3. Matters for the consideration of which machinery is established by any special statute under which a particular public undertaking is established. Effectiveness of the committee is limited by - 1. It cannot take up the examination of more than ten to twelve public undertakings in a year. 2. Its work is in the nature of a post-mortem. 3. It does not look into technical matters as its members are not technical experts.  4. Its recommendations are advisory and not binding on the ministries.   `,

            `D. All of the above `,
        ],
        answer: `Answer: D`,
        exp: `Explanation - Answer is D. On the recommendation of the Rules Committee of the Lok Sabha, 17 Departmentally-Related Standing Committees (DRSCs) were set up in the Parliament in 1993.  In 2004, number was increased from 17 to 24. The main objective of the standing committees is to secure more accountability of the Executive (i.e., the Council of Ministers) to the Parliament, particularly financial accountability. They also assist the Parliament in debating the budget more effectively. The 24 standing committees cover under their jurisdiction all the ministries/departments of the Central Government. In 1989, three Standing Committees were constituted which dealt with Agriculture, Science and Technology and Environment and Forests.  In 1993, they were superseded by the Departmentally-Related Standing Committees (DRSCs). Each standing committee consists of 31 members (21 from Lok Sabha and 10 from Rajya Sabha). The members of the Lok Sabha are nominated by the Speaker from amongst its own members, just as the members of the Rajya Sabha are nominated by the Chairman from amongst its members. A minister is not eligible to be nominated as a member of any of the standing committees.  In case a member, after his nomination to any of the standing committees, is appointed a minister, he then ceases to be a member of the committee. The term of office of each standing committee is one year from the date of its constitution. Out of the 24 standing committees, 8 work under the Rajya Sabha and 16 under the Lok Sabha. Functions - 1. To consider the demands for grants of the concerned ministries/departments before they are discussed and voted in the Lok Sabha. Its report should not suggest anything of the nature of cut motions.  2. To examine bills pertaining to the concerned ministries/departments. 3. To consider annual reports of ministries/departments. 4. To consider national basic long-term policy documents presented to the Houses. Limitations on the functioning of standing committees are - 1. They should not consider the matters of day-to-day administration of the concerned ministries/departments. 2. They should not generally consider the matters which are considered by other parliamentary committees. 3. It should be noted here that the recommendations of these committees are advisory in nature and hence not binding on the Parliament.   `,

            `D. Neither 1 nor 2 `,
        ],
        answer: `Answer: B`,
        exp: `Explanation - Answer is B. Any act or omission which obstructs a House of Parliament, its member or its officer in the performance of their functions or which has a tendency, directly or indirectly to produce results against the dignity, authority and honor of the House is treated as contempt of the House. Though the two phrases, ‘breach of privilege’ and ‘contempt of the House’ are used interchangeably, they have different implications.  Normally, a breach of privilege may amount to contempt of the House. Contempt of the House, however, has wider implications. There may be contempt of the House without specifically committing a breach of privilege. Sources of Privileges - Originally, the Constitution (Article 105) explicitly mentions two privileges, that is, freedom of speech in Parliament and right of publication of its proceedings.  With regard to other privileges, it provided that they were to be the same as those of the British House of Commons, its committees and its members on the date of its commencement (i.e., 26 January, 1950), until defined by Parliament. The 44thAmendment Act of 1978 provided that the other privileges of each House of Parliament, its committees and its members are to be those which they had on the date of its commencement (i.e., 20 June, 1979), until defined by Parliament. The amendment has made only verbal changes by dropping a direct reference to the British House of Commons, without making any change in the implication of the provision.   `,

            `D. All of the above `,
        ],
        answer: `Answer: C`,
        exp: `Explanation - Answer is C. Legislative Powers and Functions - The primary function of Parliament is to make laws for the governance of the country.  It has exclusive power to make laws on the subjects in the Union List (which at present has 100 subjects, originally 97 subjects) and on the residuary subjects (that is, subjects not enumerated in any of the 3 lists). With regard to Concurrent List (which has at present 52 subjects, originally 47 subjects), the Parliament has overriding powers, i.e. the law of Parliament prevails over the law of the state legislature in case of a conflict between the two. The Constitution also empowers the Parliament to make laws on the subjects enumerated in the State List under the following 5 abnormal circumstances - 1. When Rajya Sabha passes a resolution to that effect. 2. When a proclamation of National Emergency is in operation. 3. When two or more states make a joint request to the Parliament.  4. When necessary to give effect to international agreements, treaties and conventions. 5. When President’s Rule is in operation in the state. All the ordinances issued by the president (during the recess of the Parliament) must be approved by the Parliament within six weeks after its reassembly. An ordinance becomes inoperative if it is not approved by the parliament within that period. The Parliament makes laws in a skeleton form and authorises the Executive to make detailed rules and regulations within the framework of the parent law.  This is known as delegated legislation or executive legislation or subordinate legislation. Such rules and regulations are placed before the Parliament for its examination. Executive Powers and Functions - The Executive is responsible to the Parliament for its policies and acts. The Parliament exercises control over the Executive through questionhour, zero hour, half-an-hour discussion, short duration discussion, calling attention motion, adjournment motion, no-confidence motion, censure motion and other discussions. It also supervises the activities of the Executive with the help of its committees.  The ministers are collectively responsible to the Parliament in general and to the Lok Sabha in particular. As a part of collective responsibility, there is individual responsibility, that is, each minister is individually responsible for the efficient administration of the ministry under his charge. The council of ministers can be removed from office by the Lok Sabha by passing a no-confidence motion. The Lok Sabha can also express lack of confidence in the government in the following ways - 1. By not passing a motion of thanks on the President’s inaugural address. 2. By rejecting a money bill.  3. By passing a censure motion or an adjournment motion. 4. By defeating the government on a vital issue. 5. By passing a cut motion. Therefore, “the first function of Parliament can be said to be to select the group which is to form the government, support and sustain it in power so long as it enjoys its confidence, and to expel it when it ceases to do so, and leave it to the people to decide at the next general election.”   `,

The ministry of parliamentary affairs provides necessary training and encouragement to the states in introducing the scheme. The idea of organizing “Youth Parliaments’ in educational institutions was conceived by the Fourth All India Whips Conference held at Bombay in 1962 which made, inter-alia, the following recommendation - “This Committee recommends that Government should encourage holding of Mock Parliament in educational institutions and through Panchayats in rural areas.” The scheme wishes to strengthen the roots of democracy, inculcate healthy habits of discipline, tolerance of views of others and to enable the student community to have better awareness about the working of Parliament.

It drastically reduces expenditure incurred on irregular elections as well as corruption at the political level. 5. For the first time a proper and clear constitutional recognition is provided to political parties. Criticism of Anti-Defection Law - It doesn’t differentiate between defection and dissent. It curtails the legislator’s right to dissent and freedom of conscience. Thus, it clearly puts party bossism on a pedestal and sanctions tyranny of the party in the name of the party discipline. The difference it accords to individual defection and group defection is irrational. Thus ‘it banned only retail defections and legalized wholesale defections’. It does not consider the expulsion of a legislator from his party for his activities outside the legislature. The discrimination it undertakes between an independent member and a nominated member is illogical. For both the rules are different. Giving the decision-making authority to presiding officer is criticized because he may not exercise this authority in an impartial and objective manner. Also, the officer lacks the legal knowledge and experience to adjudicate upon the cases.   `,
