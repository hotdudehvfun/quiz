#Which act separated for the first time provincial budgets from the Central budget and authorised the Provincial legislatures to enact their budgets?
A. Act of 1909
B. Act of 1919
C. Government of India Act of 1935
D. Act of 1892
Answer: B
Explanation - Answer is B. Features of the India Act of 1919 1. It relaxed the central control over the provinces by demarcating and separating the central and provincial subjects. The central and provincial legislatures were authorised to make laws on their respective list of subjects. However, the structure of government continued to be centralised and unitary. 2. It further divided the provincial subjects into two parts— transferred and reserved. The transferred subjects were to be administered by the governor with the aid of ministers responsible to the legislative Council. The reserved subjects, on the other hand, were to be administered by the governor and his executive council without being responsible to the legislative Council. This dual scheme of governance was known as ‘dyarchy’—a term derived from the Greek word di-arche which means double rule. However, this experiment was largely unsuccessful. 3. It introduced, for the first time, bicameralism and direct elections in the country. Thus, the Indian Legislative Council was replaced by a bicameral legislature consisting of an Upper House (Council of State) and a Lower House (Legislative Assembly). The majority of members of both the Houses were chosen by direct election. 4. It required that the three of the six members of the Viceroy’s executive Council (other than the commander-in-chief) were to be Indian. 5. It extended the principle of communal representation by providing separate electorates for Sikhs, Indian Christians, Anglo-Indians and Europeans. 6. It granted franchise to a limited number of people on the basis of property, tax or education. 7. It created a new office of the High Commissioner for India in London and transferred to him some of the functions hitherto performed by the Secretary of State for India. 8. It provided for the establishment of a public service commission. Hence, a Central Public Service Commission was set up in 1926 for recruiting civil servants. 9. It separated, for the first time, provincial budgets from the Central budget and authorised the provincial legislatures to enact their budgets. 10. It provided for the appointment of a statutory commission to inquire into and report on its working after ten years of its coming into force

C. Both of them
D. Neither of them
Answer: C
Explanation - Answer is C.\n The doctrine of sovereignty of Parliament is associsted with the\n British Parliament while the principle of judicial supremacy with that of\n the American Supreme Court.\n Just as the Indian parliamentary system differs from the British\n system, the scope of judicial review power of the Supreme Court in\n India is narrower than that of what exists in US.\n This is because the American Constitution provides for 'due process of\n law' against that of 'procedure established by law' contained in the\n Indian Constitution (Article 21).\n Therefore, the framers of the Indian Constitution have preferred a\n proper synthesis between the British principle of parliamentary\n sovereignty and the American principle of judicial supremacy.

#Indian brand of socialism is
A. Democratic socialism
B. State socialism
C. Communist socialism
D. None of them
Answer: A
Explanation - Answer is A. The Indian brand of socialism is a 'democratic socialism' and not a communistic socialism (also known as 'state socialism') which involves the nationalisation of all means of production and distribution and the abolition of private property. Democratic socialism, on the other hand, holds faith in a 'mixed economy' where both public and private sectors co-exist side by side. As the Supreme Court says, 'Democratic socialism aims to end poverty, ignorance, disease and inequality of opportunity'. Indian socialism is a blend of Marxism and Gandhism, leaning heavily towards Gandhian socialism. The new economic policy (1991) of liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation has, however, diluted the socialist credentials of the Indian State


#Consider the following statements. \n 1. The term 'Republic' in our Preamble indicates that India has an elected head called the president. \n 2. He is elected directly for a fixed period of five years \n Which of these statements are correct?

B. 2 only
C. Both of them
D. Neither of them
Answer: A
Explanation - Answer is A. 1 only. He is elected indirectly for a fixed period of five years. So statement 2nd is incorrect. A democratic polity can be classified into two categories-monarchy and republic. In a monarchy, the head of the state (usually king or queen) enjoys a hereditary position, that is, he comes into office through succession, eg, Britain. In a republic, on the other hand, the head of the state is always elected directly or indirectly for a fixed period, eg, USA. Therefore, the term 'republic' in our Preamble indicates that India has an elected head called the president. He is elected indirectly for a fixed period of five years. A republic also means two more things: one, vesting of political sovereignty in the people and not in a single individual like a king; second, the absence of any privileged class and hence all public offices being opened to every citizen without any discrimination

#Consider the following statements

3. The resolution remains in force only for 6 months
Which of these statements are correct?
A. 1 and 2 only
B. 2 and 3 only

C. 1 and 3 only
D. All of them
Answer: A
Explanation - Answer is A
Parliament makes laws on subjects in State List in the following
scenarios -
When Rajya Sabha passes a resolution to that effect -
Parliament can make laws on a matter in state list, if the Rajya Sabha
says that it is necessary in the national interest that Parliament should
make laws on that matter
This resolution must be supported by two-thirds of the members of
Rajya Sabha, present and voting
The resolution remains in force only for one year

It can be renewed again and again but not exceeding one year at a time
The laws made under the resolution too cease to have effect on the
expiration of six months after the resolution has ceased to be in force
The state legislature toocan make laws on the same matter, but, in
case of conflict parliamentary law prevails
During a National Emergency -
When a proclamation of national emergency is in operation, parliament
can legislate on subjects of the state list
Here too the laws become ineffective on the expiry of six months
after the emergency has ceased to operate

Here again, state can make laws but in case of conflict parliamentary
law prevails
When States make a request for it -
Parliament can also make laws on subjects in the state list when the
legislatures of two or more states pass resolutions requesting the
Parliament to enact laws on that matter
This law enacted by the Parliament will apply only to the concerned
states i.e., states who have passed such a resolution
But even other states are allowed to adopt the law by passing a
resolution in their legislatures
However only Parliament can amend or repeal such a law

The state legislature looses the power to make a law with respect to
that subject
Some examples are -Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994; Prize
Competition Act, 1955; Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972; Water
(Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, etc
For implementing International Agreements -
For implementing the international treaties, agreements or
conventions, the Parliament is authorized to make laws on any subject
in the State List
Examples - Legislations related to TRIPS; Anti-Hijacking Act, 1982;
etc
During President’s Rule -

Parliament can make laws with respect to any subject in the State List
in relation to that state, when President’s rule is in force in that state
Even if the President’s Rule ends, the law remains in force in the state
However, State legislature can repeal or alter or re-enact that law


#Consider the following statements

subject enumerated in the Concurrent List, the Central law prevails
over the state law
2. But, there is an exception. If the state law has been reserved for
the consideration of the president and has received his assent, then
the state law prevails in that state
3. In such a situation, Parliament can not override such a law

Which of these statements are correct?
A. 1 and 2 only
B. 2 and 3 only
C. 1 and 3 only
D. All of them
Answer: A
Explanation - Answer is A
In case of a conflict between the Central law and the state law on a
subject enumerated in the Concurrent List, the Central law prevails
over the state law
But, there is an exception. If the state law has been reserved for the
consideration of the president and has received his assent, then the
state law prevails in that state
But, it would still be competent for the Parliament to override such a
law by subsequently making a law on the same matter. So statement
3rd is incorrect

functions of the state


#Under which article the constitution authorises the Parliament
to create new all India services on the basis of Rajya Sabha
resolution to that effect?
A. Article 315
B. Article 314
C. Article 313
D. Article 312
Answer: D
Explanation - Answer is D
Like in any other federation, the Centre and the states also have their
separate public services called as the Central Services and the State
Services respectively

In addition, there are all India services-IAS, IPS and IFS. The
members of these services occupy top positions (or key posts) under
both the Centre and the states and serve them by turns. But, they are
recruited and trained by the Centre
These services are controlled jointly by the Centre and the states. The
ultimate control lies with the.Central government while the immediate
control vests with the state governments
In 1947, Indian Civil Service (ICS) was replaced by IAS and the Indian
Police (IP) was replaced by IPS and were recognised by the
Constitution as All - India Services. In 1966, the Indian Forest Service
(IFS) was created as the third All-India Service
Article 312 of the Constitution authorises the Parliament to create
new All-India Services on the basis of a Rajya Sabha resolution to that
effect
Each of these three all-India services, irrespective of their division
among different states, form a single service with common rights and
status and uniform scales of pay throughout the country
