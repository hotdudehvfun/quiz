    question: ` If president of India exercises his power under article 356 of the constitution in the respect of a particular state, then - `,
    options: [


        ` A. Article 19 is suspended in that state. `,
        ` B. Assembly of that state is dissolved automatically. `,
        ` C. The president can also get powers of the state high courts. `,
        ` D. Parliament assumes the power to legislate on subject in the state list. `,
    ],




    answer: `Answer: D`,
    exp: ` Explanation - Answer is D The President acquires the following powers when the President’s Rule is imposed in a state - 1. He can take up the functions of the state government and powers vested in the governor or any other executive authority in the state. 2. He can declare that the powers of the state legislature are to be exercised by the Parliament. 3. He can take all other necessary steps including the suspension of the constitutional provisions relating to anybody or authority in the state. The President dismisses the state council of ministers headed by the chief minister. The state governor, on behalf of the President, carries on the state administration with the help of the chief secretary of the state or the advisors appointed by the President. This is the reason why a proclamation under Article 356 is popularly known as the imposition of ‘President’s Rule’ in a state. Further, the President either suspends or dissolves the state legislative assembly. In case of dissolution fresh elections are held for the state assembly. The Parliament passes the state legislative bills and the state budget. When the state legislature is thus suspended or dissolved - 1. The Parliament can delegate the power to make laws for the state to the President or to any other authority specified by him in this regard. 2. The Parliament or in case of delegation, the President or any other specified authority can make laws conferring powers and imposing duties on the Centre or its officers and authorities, the President can authorize, when the Lok Sabha is not in session, expenditure from the state consolidated fund pending its sanction by the Parliament. 3. The President can promulgate, when the Parliament is not in session, ordinances for the governance of the state. A law made by the Parliament or president or any other specified authority continues to be operative even after the President’s Rule. This means that the period for which such a law remains in force is not co-terminus with the duration of the proclamation. But it can be repealed or altered or re-enacted by the state legislature. It should be noted here that the President cannot assume to himself the powers vested in the concerned state high court or suspend the provisions of the Constitution relating to it. In other words, the constitutional position, status, powers and functions of the concerned state high court remain same even during the President’s Rule. `

    question: ` Which of the following sentence/sentences is/are correct? \n 1) During National Emergency, life of the Lok Sabha may be extended for one year at a time. \n 2) Fundamental Rights under Article 19 can be suspended only when the National Emergency is declared on the ground of war. Choose from the following options. `,
    options: [


        ` A. Only 1 `,
        ` B. Only 2 `,
        ` C. Both 1 and 2 `,
        ` D. Neither 1 nor 2 `,
    ],




    answer: `Answer: C`,
    exp: ` Explanation - Answer is C. Effect on the Life of the Lok Sabha and State Assembly - While a proclamation of National Emergency is in operation, the life of the Lok Sabha may be extended beyond its normal term (five years) by a law of Parliament for one year at a time (for any length of time). However, this extension cannot continue beyond a period of six months after the emergency has ceased to operate. For example, the term of the Fifth Lok Sabha (1971-1977) was extended two times by one year at a time. Similarly, the Parliament may extend the normal tenure of a state legislative assembly (five years) by one year each time (for any length of time) during a national emergency. This is subject to a maximum period of six months after the Emergency has ceased to operate. Effect on the Fundamental Rights - Articles 358 and 359 describe the effect of a National Emergency on the Fundamental Rights. Article 358 deals with the suspension of the Fundamental Rights guaranteed by Article 19. Article 359 deals with the suspension of other Fundamental Rights (except those guaranteed by Articles 20 and 21). According to Article 358, when a proclamation of national emergency is made, the six Fundamental Rights under Article 19 are automatically suspended. No separate order for their suspension is required. While a proclamation of national emergency is in operation, the state is freed from the restrictions imposed by Article 19. In other words, the state can make any law or can take any executive action abridging or taking away the six Fundamental Rights guaranteed by Article 19. Any such law or executive action cannot be challenged on the ground that they are inconsistent with the six Fundamental Rights guaranteed by Article 19. When the National Emergency ceases to operate,Article 19 automatically revives and comes into force. Any law made during Emergency, to the extent of inconsistency with Article 19, ceases to have effect. However, no remedy lies for anything done during the Emergency even after the Emergency expires. This means that the legislative and executive actions taken during the emergency cannot be challenged even after the Emergency ceases to operate. The 44th Amendment Act of 1978 restricted the scope of Article 358 in two ways - Firstly, the six Fundamental Rights under Article 19 can be suspended only when the National Emergency is declared on the ground of war or external aggression and not on the ground of armed rebellion. Secondly, only those laws which are related with the Emergency are protected from being challenged and not other laws. Also, the executive action taken only under such a law is protected. `

    question: ` In case of declaration of financial emergency - `,
    options: [

        ` C. It can be passed by a simple majority parliament `,

        ` D. All the state assemblies will be put under suspension and laws on the state list will be enacted by`
    ],

    answer: `Answer: C`,
    exp: ` Explanation - Answer is C. Article 360 empowers the president to proclaima Financial Emergency if he is satisfied that a situation has arisen due to which the financial stability or credit of India or any part of its territory is threatened. The 38th Amendment Act of 1975 made the satisfaction of the president in declaring a Financial Emergency final and conclusive and not questionable in any court on any ground. But, this provision was subsequently deleted by the 44thAmendment Act of 1978 implying that the satisfaction of the president is not beyond judicial review. A proclamation declaring financial emergency must be approved by both the Houses of Parliament within two months from the date of its issue. However, if the proclamation of Financial Emergency is issued at a time when the Lok Sabha has been dissolved or the dissolution of the Lok Sabha takes place during the period of two months without approving the proclamation, then the proclamation survives until 30 days from the first sitting of the Lok Sabha after its reconstitution, provided the Rajya Sabha has in the meantime approved it. Once approved by both the Houses of Parliament, the Financial Emergency continues indefinitely till it is revoked. This implies two things - (a) There is no maximum period prescribed for its operation; and (b) Repeated parliamentary approval is not required for its continuation. A resolution approving the proclamation of financial emergency can be passed by either House of Parliament only by a simple majority, that is, a majority of the members of that house present and voting. A proclamation of Financial Emergency may be revoked by the president at any time by a subsequent proclamation. Such a proclamation does not require the parliamentary approval. `

    answer: `Answer: C`,
    exp: ` Explanation - Answer is C. Some members of the Constituent Assembly criticized the incorporation of emergency provisions in the Constitution on the following grounds - (a) The federal character of the Constitution will be destroyed and the Union will become all. (b) powerful. (c) The powers of the State - both the Union and the units - will entirely be concentrated in the hands of the Union executive. (d) The President will become a dictator. (e) The financial autonomy of the state will be nullified. (f) Fundamental rights will become meaningless and, as a result, the democratic foundations of the Constitution will be destroyed. However, there were also protagonists of the emergency provisions in the Constituent Assembly. Sir Alladi Krishnaswami Ayyar labelled them as ‘the very life-breath of the Constitution’. Mahabir Tyagi opined that they would work as a ‘safety-valve’ and thereby help in the maintenance of the Constitution. While defending the emergency provisions in the Constituent Assembly, Dr B. R. Ambedkar also accepted the possibility of their misuse. He observed, ‘I do not altogether deny that there is a possibility of the Articles being abused or employed for political purposes’. `

    answer: `Answer: C`,
    exp: ` Explanation - Answer is C. The Sarkaria Commission on Centre-State Relations (1983–87) recommended establishment of a permanent Inter-State Council under Article 263 of the Constitution. It recommended that in order to differentiate the Inter-State Council from other bodies established under the same Article 263, it must be called as the Inter-Governmental Council. The Commission recommended that the Council should be charged with the duties laid down in clauses (b) and (c) of Article 263. In pursuance, the Janata Dal Government headed by V. P. Singh established the Inter-State Council in 1990. It consists of the following members - 1. Prime minister as the Chairman. 2. Chief ministers of all the states. 3. Chief ministers of union territories having legislative assemblies. 4. Administrators of union territories not having legislative assemblies. 5. Governors of States under President’s rule. 6. Six Central cabinet ministers, including the home minister, to be nominated by the Prime Minister. 7. Five Ministers of Cabinet rank / Minister of State (independent charge) nominated by the Chairman of the Council (i.e., Prime Minister) are permanent invitees to the Council. The council is a recommendatory body on issues relating to inter-state, Centre-state and Centre-union territories relations. It aims at promoting coordination between them by examining, discussing and deliberating on such issues. Its duties are - investigating and discussing such subjects in which the states or the center have a common interest; making recommendations upon any such subject for the better coordination of policy and action on it; and deliberating upon such other matters of general interest to the states as may be referred to it by the chairman. The Council may meet at least thrice in a year. Its meetings are held in camera and all questions are decided by consensus. There is also a Standing Committee of the Council. It was set up in 1996 for continuous consultation and processing of matters for the consideration of the Council. It consists of the following members - 1. Union Home Minister as the Chairman. 2. Five Union Cabinet Ministers. 3. Nine Chief Ministers. The Council is assisted by a secretariat called the Inter-State Council Secretariat. This secretariat was set-up in 1991 and is headed by a secretary to the Government of India. Since 2011, it is also functioning as the secretariat of the Zonal Councils. `

        ` A. 1,3 and 4 only `,
        ` B. 2, 3 only `,
        ` C. 3 only `,
        ` D. All of the above `,
    ],




    answer: `Answer: D`,
    exp: ` Explanation - Answer is D. Article 263 contemplates the establishment of an Inter-State Council to effect co-ordination between the states and between Centre and states. The President can establish such a council if at any time, it appears to him that the public interest would be served by its establishment. He can define the nature of duties to be performed by such a council and its organization and procedure. Even though the president is empowered to define the duties of an inter-state council, Article 263 specifies the duties that can be assigned to it in the following manner - (a) enquiring into and advising upon disputes which may arise between states; (b) investigating and discussing subjects in which the states or the Centre and the states have a common interest; and (c) making recommendations upon any such subject, and particularly for the better co-ordination of policy and action on it. The council’s function to enquire and advice upon inter-state disputes is complementary to the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction under Article 131 to decide a legal controversy between the governments. The Council can deal with any controversy whether legal or non-legal, but its function is advisory unlike that of the court which gives a binding decision. Under the above provisions of Article 263, the president has established the following councils to make recommendations for the better coordination of policy and action in the related subjects (a) Central Council of Health. (b) Central Council of Local Government and Urban Development. (c) Four Regional Councils for Sales Tax for the Northern, Eastern, Western and Southern Zones. The Central Council of Indian Medicine and the Central Council of Homoeopathy were set up under the Acts of Parliament. `

    exp: ` Explanation - Answer is C. The President is the head of the State and his power extends both to the administration by the Centre as well as to the states. Consequently, it is necessary that in his election, not only members of Parliament should play their part, but the members of the state legislatures should have a voice. But, when we come to the Vice-President, his normal functions are to preside over the council of states. It is only on a rare occasion, and that too for a temporary period, that he may be called upon to assume the duties of the president. That being so, it does not seem necessary that the members of the state legislatures should also be invited to take part in the election of the Vice-President. `

However, he can resign from his office at any time by addressing the resignation letter to the President. He can also be removed from the office before completion of his term. A formal impeachment is not required for his removal.

But, no suchnresolution can be moved unless at least 14 days' advance notice has been given. Notably, no ground has been mentioned in the Constitution for his removal. The Vice-President can hold office beyond his term of five years until his successor assumes charge. He is also eligible for re-election to that office. He may be elected for any number of terms. `

    answer: `Answer: D`,
    exp: ` Explanation - Answer is D. Though the Constitution has adopted the system of proportional representation in the case of Rajya Sabha, it has not preferred the same system in the case of Lok Sabha. Instead, it has adopted the system of territorial representation for the election of members to the Lok Sabha. Under territorial representation, every member of the legislature represents a geographical area known as a constituency. From each constituency, only one representative is elected. Hence such a constituency is known as single-member constituency. In this system, a candidate who secures majority of votes is declared elected. This simple majority system of representation does not represent the whole electorate. In other words, it does not secure due representation to minorities (small groups). The system of proportional representation aims at removing the defects of territorial representation. Under this system, all sections of the people get representation in proportion to their number. `

About: Article 137 of the Constitution gives Supreme Court the power to review any of its judgments or orders. The court has the power to review its rulings to correct a “patent error” and not “minor mistakes of inconsequential import”. Grounds for review petition: In a 2013 ruling, the Supreme Court itself laid down three grounds for seeking a review of a verdict it has delivered — the discovery of new and important matter or evidence which was not within the knowledge of the petitioner or could not be produced by him; mistake or error apparent on the face of the record; or any other sufficient reason which means a reason that is analogous to the other two grounds. Who can file a review petition? It is not necessary that only parties to a case can seek a review of the judgment on it. Any person aggrieved by a ruling can seek a review. Time frame: As per 1996 rules framed by the Supreme Court, a review petition must be filed within 30 days of the date of judgment or order. While a judgment is the final decision in a case, an order is an interim ruling that is subject to its final verdict. `

It stated that “the district is the proper unit for planning and development and the Zila Parishad should become the principal body for management of all development programs which can be handled at that level.” 3. The Panchayati Raj institutions at the district and lower levels must be assigned an important role with respect to planning, implementation and monitoring of rural development programs.
