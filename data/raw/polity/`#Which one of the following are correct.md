Q1: If president of India exercises his power under article 356 of the
constitution in the respect of a particular state, then -
A. Article 19 is suspended in that state.
B. Assembly of that state is dissolved automatically.
C. The president can also get powers of the state high courts.
D. Parliament assumes the power to legislate on subject in the state
list.
Explanation - Answer is D
The President acquires the following powers when the President’s Rule
is imposed in a state -
1. He can take up the functions of the state government and powers
vested in the governor or any other executive authority in the state.

2. He can declare that the powers of the state legislature are to be
exercised by the Parliament.
3. He can take all other necessary steps including the suspension of the
constitutional provisions relating to anybody or authority in the state.
The President dismisses the state council of ministers headed by the
chief minister.
The state governor, on behalf of the President, carries on the state
administration with the help of the chief secretary of the state or the
advisors appointed by the President.
This is the reason why a proclamation under Article 356 is popularly
known as the imposition of ‘President’s Rule’ in a state.
Further, the President either suspends or dissolves the state
legislative assembly.

In case of dissolution fresh elections are held for the state assembly.
The Parliament passes the state legislative bills and the state budget.
When the state legislature is thus suspended or dissolved -
1. The Parliament can delegate the power to make laws for the state to
the President or to any other authority specified by him in this regard.
2. The Parliament or in case of delegation, the President or any other
specified authority can make laws conferring powers and imposing
duties on the Centre or its officers and authorities, the President can
authorize, when the Lok Sabha is not in session, expenditure from the
state consolidated fund pending its sanction by the Parliament.
3. The President can promulgate, when the Parliament is not in session,
ordinances for the governance of the state.

A law made by the Parliament or president or any other specified
authority continues to be operative even after the President’s Rule.
This means that the period for which such a law remains in force is not
co-terminus with the duration of the proclamation.
But it can be repealed or altered or re-enacted by the state
legislature.
It should be noted here that the President cannot assume to himself
the powers vested in the concerned state high court or suspend the
provisions of the Constitution relating to it.
In other words, the constitutional position, status, powers and
functions of the concerned state high court remain same even during
the President’s Rule.



Q2: Which of the following sentence/sentences is/are correct?
1) During National Emergency, life of the Lok Sabha may be extended
for one year at a time.
2) Fundamental Rights under Article 19 can be suspended only when the
National Emergency is declared on the ground of war.
Choose from the following options.
A. Only 1
B. Only 2
C. Both 1 and 2
D. Neither 1 nor 2
Explanation - Answer is C.
Effect on the Life of the Lok Sabha and State Assembly -

While a proclamation of National Emergency is in operation, the life of
the Lok Sabha may be extended beyond its normal term (five years) by
a law of Parliament for one year at a time (for any length of time).
However, this extension cannot continue beyond a period of six months
after the emergency has ceased to operate.
For example, the term of the Fifth Lok Sabha (1971-1977) was
extended two times by one year at a time.
Similarly, the Parliament may extend the normal tenure of a state
legislative assembly (five years) by one year each time (for any length
of time) during a national emergency.
This is subject to a maximum period of six months after the
Emergency has ceased to operate.

Effect on the Fundamental Rights -
Articles 358 and 359 describe the effect of a National Emergency on
the Fundamental Rights.
Article 358 deals with the suspension of the Fundamental Rights
guaranteed by Article 19.
Article 359 deals with the suspension of other Fundamental Rights
(except those guaranteed by Articles 20 and 21).
According to Article 358, when a proclamation of national emergency is
made, the six Fundamental Rights under Article 19 are automatically
suspended.

No separate order for their suspension is required.
While a proclamation of national emergency is in operation, the state is
freed from the restrictions imposed by Article 19.
In other words, the state can make any law or can take any executive
action abridging or taking away the six Fundamental Rights guaranteed
by Article 19.
Any such law or executive action cannot be challenged on the ground
that they are inconsistent with the six Fundamental Rights guaranteed
by Article 19.
When the National Emergency ceases to operate,Article 19
automatically revives and comes into force.

Any law made during Emergency, to the extent of inconsistency with
Article 19, ceases to have effect.
However, no remedy lies for anything done during the Emergency even
after the Emergency expires.
This means that the legislative and executive actions taken during the
emergency cannot be challenged even after the Emergency ceases to
operate.
The 44th Amendment Act of 1978 restricted the scope of Article 358
in two ways -
Firstly, the six Fundamental Rights under Article 19 can be suspended
only when the National Emergency is declared on the ground of war or
external aggression and not on the ground of armed rebellion.

Secondly, only those laws which are related with the Emergency are
protected from being challenged and not other laws.
Also, the executive action taken only under such a law is protected.


Q3: In case of declaration of financial emergency -
A. All money bills of state compulsorily will be considered and passed
only by the parliament
B. All the state governments will dissolve and management of the
economy will be taken over the union government
C. It can be passed by a simple majority
D. All the state assemblies will be put under suspension and laws on the
state list will be enacted by parliament

Explanation - Answer is C.
Article 360 empowers the president to proclaima Financial Emergency
if he is satisfied that a situation has arisen due to which the financial
stability or credit of India or any part of its territory is threatened.
The 38th Amendment Act of 1975 made the satisfaction of the
president in declaring a Financial Emergency final and conclusive and
not questionable in any court on any ground.
But, this provision was subsequently deleted by the 44thAmendment
Act of 1978 implying that the satisfaction of the president is not
beyond judicial review.
A proclamation declaring financial emergency must be approved by both
the Houses of Parliament within two months from the date of its issue.

However, if the proclamation of Financial Emergency is issued at a time
when the Lok Sabha has been dissolved or the dissolution of the Lok
Sabha takes place during the period of two months without approving
the proclamation, then the proclamation survives until 30 days from
the first sitting of the Lok Sabha after its reconstitution, provided
the Rajya Sabha has in the meantime approved it.
Once approved by both the Houses of Parliament, the Financial
Emergency continues indefinitely till it is revoked.
This implies two things -
(a) There is no maximum period prescribed for its operation; and
(b) Repeated parliamentary approval is not required for its
continuation.

A resolution approving the proclamation of financial emergency can be
passed by either House of Parliament only by a simple majority, that is,
a majority of the members of that house present and voting.
A proclamation of Financial Emergency may be revoked by the
president at any time by a subsequent proclamation. Such a
proclamation does not require the parliamentary approval.


Q4: Which of the following statements is/are true?
1) Critics claim that emergency provisions undermine the Fundamental
Rights.
2) President becomes dictator by emergency provisions as per the
critics.
Choose from the following options.
A. Only 1
B. Only 2

C. Both 1 and 2
D. Neither 1 nor 2
Explanation - Answer is C.

Union will become all.
(b) powerful.
(c) The powers of the State - both the Union and the units - will
entirely be concentrated in the hands of the Union executive.
(d) The President will become a dictator.

(e) The financial autonomy of the state will be nullified.
(f) Fundamental rights will become meaningless and, as a result, the
democratic foundations of the Constitution will be destroyed.
However, there were also protagonists of the emergency provisions in
the Constituent Assembly.
Sir Alladi Krishnaswami Ayyar labelled them as ‘the very life-breath of
the Constitution’.
Mahabir Tyagi opined that they would work as a ‘safety-valve’ and
thereby help in the maintenance of the Constitution.
While defending the emergency provisions in the Constituent
Assembly, Dr B. R. Ambedkar also accepted the possibility of their
misuse.

He observed, ‘I do not altogether deny that there is a possibility of
the Articles being abused or employed for political purposes’.

Rule without probing the possibility of forming an alternative ministry.
b. Where the governor makes his own assessment of the support of a
ministry in the assembly and recommends imposition of President’s Rule
without allowing the ministry to prove its majority on the floor of the
Assembly.

The Sarkaria Commission on Centre-State Relations (1983–87)
recommended establishment of a permanent Inter-State Council under
Article 263 of the Constitution.
It recommended that in order to differentiate the Inter-State Council
from other bodies established under the same Article 263, it must be
called as the Inter-Governmental Council.
The Commission recommended that the Council should be charged with
the duties laid down in clauses (b) and (c) of Article 263.

In pursuance, the Janata Dal Government headed by V. P. Singh
established the Inter-State Council in 1990.
It consists of the following members -

7. Five Ministers of Cabinet rank / Minister of State (independent
charge) nominated by the Chairman of the Council (i.e., Prime Minister)
are permanent invitees to the Council.
The council is a recommendatory body on issues relating to inter-state,
Centre-state and Centre-union territories relations.
It aims at promoting coordination between them by examining,
discussing and deliberating on such issues.
Its duties are -
investigating and discussing such subjects in which the states or the
center have a common interest;
making recommendations upon any such subject for the better
coordination of policy and action on it; and

deliberating upon such other matters of general interest to the states
as may be referred to it by the chairman.
The Council may meet at least thrice in a year. Its meetings are held in

consideration of the Council.
It consists of the following members -
1. Union Home Minister as the Chairman.
2. Five Union Cabinet Ministers.

3. Nine Chief Ministers.
The Council is assisted by a secretariat called the Inter-State Council

Government of India.
Since 2011, it is also functioning as the secretariat of the Zonal
Councils.


Q10: Which of the following are established under article 263?
1. Central Council of Local Government.

2. Regional Council for Sales Tax.
3 Inter-State Council.
4 Central Council of Health.
Choose from the following options.
A. 1,3 and 4 only
B. 2, 3 only
C. 3 only
D. All of the above
Explanation - Answer is D.
Article 263 contemplates the establishment of an Inter-State Council
to effect co-ordination between the states and between Centre and
states.

The President can establish such a council if at any time, it appears to
him that the public interest would be served by its establishment.
He can define the nature of duties to be performed by such a council
and its organization and procedure.
Even though the president is empowered to define the duties of an
inter-state council, Article 263 specifies the duties that can be
assigned to it in the following manner -
(a) enquiring into and advising upon disputes which may arise between
states;
(b) investigating and discussing subjects in which the states or the
Centre and the states have a common interest; and

(c) making recommendations upon any such subject, and particularly for
the better co-ordination of policy and action on it.
The council’s function to enquire and advice upon inter-state disputes
is complementary to the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction under Article 131
to decide a legal controversy between the governments.
The Council can deal with any controversy whether legal or non-legal,
but its function is advisory unlike that of the court which gives a
binding decision.
Under the above provisions of Article 263, the president has
established the following councils to make recommendations for the
better coordination of policy and action in the related subjects
(a) Central Council of Health.
(b) Central Council of Local Government and Urban Development.

(c) Four Regional Councils for Sales Tax for the Northern, Eastern,
Western and Southern Zones.
The Central Council of Indian Medicine and the Central Council of
Homoeopathy were set up under the Acts of Parliament.

higher majority.
3. Suspensive veto, which can be over ridden by the legislature with an

Q1: What are the reasons for the difference in electoral college
for election of President and Vice President
1. The President is the head of the State and his power extends both
to the administration by the Centre as well as to the states
2. But when we come to the vice president, his normal functions are to
preside over the Council of States
Choose among the following options.
A. 1 only
B. 2 only
C. Both of them
D. Neither of them
Explanation - Answer is C.
The President is the head of the State and his power extends both to
the administration by the Centre as well as to the states. Consequently,

it is necessary that in his election, not only members of Parliament
should play their part, but the members of the state legislatures
should have a voice.
But, when we come to the Vice-President, his normal functions are to
preside over the council of states. It is only on a rare occasion, and
that too for a temporary period, that he may be called upon to assume
the duties of the president.
That being so, it does not seem necessary that the members of the
state legislatures should also be invited to take part in the election of
the Vice-President.


Q2: Consider the following statements.

president
2. The Oath of office to the vice president can be administered by

A. 1 only
B. 2 only
C. Both of them
D. Neither of them
Explanation - C.
Both of them are correct.
Before entering upon his office, the Vice-President has to make and
subscribe to an oath or affirmation.
In his oath, the Vice-President swears:
1. to bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India, and
2. to faithfully discharge the duties of his office.

The oath of office to the Vice-President is admin- istered by the
President or some person appointed in that behalf by him.

1. Vice president can be removed from the office before completion of
his term
2. A formal impeachment is not required for his removal
3. The vice president can be removed from office by a process of
impeachment for violation of the constitution
Choose from the following options.
A. 1 and 2 only
B. 2 and 3 only
C. 1 and 3 only
D. All of them
Explanation - Answer is A.

No ground has been mentioned in the constitution for his removal.
The Vice-President holds office for a term of five years from the date
on which he enters upon his office. However, he can resign from his
office at any time by addressing the resignation letter to the
President. He can also be removed from the office before completion
of his term.
A formal impeachment is not required for his removal. He can be
removed by a resolution of the Rajya Sabha passed by an absolute
majority (ie, a majority of the total members of the House) and agreed
to by the Lok Sabha. But, no suchnresolution can be moved unless at
least 14 days' advance notice has been given. Notably, no ground has
been mentioned in the Constitution for his removal.
The Vice-President can hold office beyond his term of five years until
his successor assumes charge.
He is also eligible for re-election to that office. He may be elected for
any number of terms.


Q4: Consider the following statements.

1. The election of a person as Vice-President cannot be challenged on

of the Supreme Court are invalidated
Which of these statements are correct?
A. 1 only
B. 2 only
C. Both of them
D. Neither of them
Explanation - Answer is A.
The election of a person as Vice-President cannot be challenged on the
ground that the electoral college was incomplete (i.e., existence of any
vacancy among the members of electoral college). If the election of a

person as Vice-President is declared void by the Supreme Court, acts
done by him before the dateof such declaration of the Supreme Court
are not invalidated (i.e., they continue to remain in force).


Q5: Consider the following statements.
1. The American Vice President succeeds to the presidency when it

predecessor.
2. The Indian Vice-President, on the other hand, does not assume the
office of the President when it falls vacant for the unexpired term.
Which of these statements are correct?
A. 1 only
B. 2 only
C. Both of them
D. Neither of them

Explanation - Answer is C.
Though the office of the Indian Vice-President is modelled on the lines
of the American Vice- President, there is a difference.
The American Vice-President succeeds to the presidency when it falls
vacant, and remains President for the unexpired term of his
predecessor. The Indian Vice-President, on the other hand, does not
assume the office of the
President when it falls vacant for the unexpired term.
He merely serves as an acting President until the new President
assumes charge.
From the above it is clear that the Constitution has not assigned any
significant function to the Vice-President in that capacity.

Though the Constitution has adopted the system of proportional
representation in the case of Rajya Sabha, it has not preferred the
same system in the case of Lok Sabha. Instead, it has adopted the system of territorial representation for the election of
members to the Lok Sabha.
Under territorial representation, every member of the legislature
represents a geographical area known as a constituency. From each
constituency, only one representative is elected. Hence such a
constituency is known as single-member constituency. In this system, a
candidate who secures majority of votes is declared elected. This
simple majority system of representation does not represent the whole
electorate. In other words, it does not secure due representation to
minorities (small groups).

review its rulings to correct a “patent error” and not “minor mistakes
of inconsequential import”.
Grounds for review petition: In a 2013 ruling, the Supreme Court itself
laid down three grounds for seeking a review of a verdict it has
delivered — the discovery of new and important matter or evidence
which was not within the knowledge of the petitioner or could not be
produced by him; mistake or error apparent on the face of the record;
or any other sufficient reason which means a reason that is analogous
to the other two grounds.

Who can file a review petition? It is not necessary that only parties to
a case can seek a review of the judgment on it. Any person aggrieved
by a ruling can seek a review.
Time frame: As per 1996 rules framed by the Supreme Court, a review
petition must be filed within 30 days of the date of judgment or order.
While a judgment is the final decision in a case, an order is an interim
ruling that is subject to its final verdict.

ACHIEVE IAS MCQ SERIES, INDIAN POLIY, DAY 24
Establishment of a 3-tier Panchayati Raj system - Gram Panchayat at
the village level, Panchayat Samiti at the block level, and District
Parishad at the district level. These tiers should be organically linked
through a device of indirect elections. The main purpose of this division
is to simplify and to decrease the work load of the state and central
government[MSD].
The village Panchayat should be constituted with directly elected
representatives, whereas the Panchayat Samiti and Zilla Parishad
should be constituted with indirectly elected members. This is because

The Climate Finance in 2013-14 and the 100 Billion Goal report released
(late 2015) OECD (Organisation for Economic Co- operation and
Development) states that the
mobilization of climate finance from developed to developing countries
had reached US$62 billion in 2014.
The report seems to include the full value of multilateral development
bank (MDB) loans as well as official development assistance (ODA),
some private finance, export credits, etc. as climate finance, leading to
double counting.
Also it includes the promises, pledges and multi-year commitments and
not actual disbursements as climate finance.
The decline in allocation of ODA to the least developed countries (LDC)
in the past year, could perhaps be linked to higher allocation to
'climate-related objectives', implying that ODA is being diverted to
'climate-related activities'.

Q7: Which of the following is/are true regarding Attorney General
of India?

2. Post of Solicitor General is not created by the Constitution
Choose from the following options:
A. 1 only
B. 2 only
C. Both of them
D. Neither of them
Explanation - Answer is C.
Article 76 provides for the office of the Attorney General for India
who is the highest law officer in the country.
Appointment and Term of the Attorney General -
The Attorney General (AG) is appointed by the President.

He must be a person who is qualified to be appointed a judge of the
Supreme Court.
That means, he must be a citizen of India and he must have been a
judge of some High Court for five years or an advocate of some High
Court for ten years or an eminent jurist, in the opinion of the
President.
The term of office of the AG is not fixed by the Constitution.
Also, the Constitution does not contain the procedure and grounds for
his removal.
He holds office during the pleasure of the President.
Thus, he may be removed by the President at any time.
He may also quit his office by submitting his resignation to the
President.

Conventionally, he resigns when the government (Council of Ministers)
resigns or is replaced.
This is because he is appointed on the government’s advice.
The remuneration of the AG is not fixed by the constitution and
receives such remuneration as the President may decide.
Solicitor General of India -
Apart from AG, there are other law officers of the Government of
India.
They are the solicitor general of India and additional solicitor general
of India.
They assist the AG in the fulfilment of his official responsibilities.
Only the office of the AG is created by the constitution.

Article 76 does not mention about the solicitor general and additional
solicitor general.
The AG is not a member of the central cabinet.
There is a separate law minister in the central cabinet to look after
legal matters at the government level.


Q8: Which of the following is/are true?
1. CAG cannot conduct propriety audit.
2. CAG is responsible only to the Parliament.
Choose from the following options.
A. Only 1

B. Only 2
C. Both 1 and 2
D. Neither 1 nor 2
Explanation - Answer is B.
Role of CAG -
CAG makes sure that executive are responsible to the Parliament in
the area of financial administration.
CAG undertakes audit of expenditure on behalf of the Parliament and
hence is an agent of Parliament.
CAG is responsible only to the Parliament.
Along with legal and regulatory audit, CAG can also conduct propriety
audit.

Propriety Audit is seeing that government expenditure follows ‘wisdom,
faithfulness and economy’.
If not, CAG can comment on the wastage and extravagance of such
expenditure.
While legal and regulatory audit is mandatory for CAG, the propriety
audit is discretionary.
CAG cannot ask for details of secret service expenditure.
He has to just accept a certificate from administrative authority
which says that the said expenditure has been incurred.
The Constitution of India sees CAG to be Comptroller as well as
Auditor General.
But the CAG has no control over the issue of money from the
consolidated fund and many departments are authorised to draw money
by issuing cheques without specific authority from the CAG, who is

concerned only at the audit stage when the expenditure has already
taken place.
Thus he is just Auditor General and not a Comptroller.
But CAG of Britain has both powers of being Comptroller as well as
Auditor General.


Q9: Which of the following is/are true regarding duties and rights
of Attorney General (AG)?

3) Business Advisory Committee.
4) Railway Convention Committee.
A. 1, 2, 3
B. 2, 3, 4
C. 3, 4
D. All of the above
Explanation - Answer is A.
The functions of the Parliament are varied, complex and voluminous.
It has neither the adequate time nor necessary expertise to make a
detailed scrutiny of all legislative measures and other matters.
Hence, it is assisted by a number of committees in the discharge of its
duties.

The Constitution of India mentions these committees, but without any
specific provisions regarding their composition, tenure, functions etc.
All these matters are dealt by the rules of two Houses.
Accordingly, a parliamentary committee means a committee that -
(a) Is appointed or elected by the House or nominated by the
Speaker/Chairman 1.
(b) Works under the direction of the Speaker/Chairman.
(c) Presents its report to the House or to the Speaker/Chairman.
(d) Has a secretariat provided by the Lok Sabha/Rajya Sabha.

The consultative committees, which also consist of members of
Parliament, are not parliamentary committees as they do not fulfill
above four conditions.
A Minister is not eligible for election or nomination to the Financial
Committees, Departmental Standing Committees, Committees on
Empowerment of Women, Government Assurances, Petitions,
Subordinate Legislation and Welfare of Scheduled Castes and
Scheduled Tribes.
Broadly, Parliamentary Committees are of 2 types - Standing
Committees and Ad Hoc Committees.
Standing Committees are permanent (constituted every year or
periodically) and work on a continuous basis.

Ad hoc Committees are temporary and cease to exist on completion of
the task assigned to them.
Standing Committees - On basis of the nature of functions, standing
committees can be classified into six categories -
1. Financial Committees -
(a) Public Accounts Committee.
(b) Estimates Committee.
(c) Committee on Public Undertakings.
2. Departmental Standing Committees (24 in number).
3. Committees to Inquire -

(a) Committee on Petitions.
(b) Committee of Privileges.
(c) Ethics Committee.
4. Committees to Scrutinize and Control-
(a) Committee on Government Assurances.
(b) Committee on Subordinate Legislation.
(c) Committee on Papers Laid on the Table.
(d) Committee on Welfare of SCs and Sts.
(e) Committee on Empowerment of Women.
(f) Joint Committee on Offices of Profit.

5. Committees Relating to the Day-to-Day Business of the House -
(a) Business Advisory Committee.
(b) Committee on Private Members’ Bills and Resolutions.
(c) Rules Committee.
(d) Committee on Absence of Members from Sittings of the House.
6. House-Keeping Committees or Service Committees (i.e., Committees
concerned with the Provision of Facilities and Services to Members) -
(a) General Purposes Committee.
(b) House Committee.
(c) Library Committee.

(d) Joint Committee on Salaries and Allowances of Members.


Q4: Which of the following is/are true regarding Consultative
Committees?
1) Consultative committees are not attached to
ministries/departments.
2) These committees are constituted by the Ministry of Parliamentary
Affairs.
A. Only 1
B. Only 2
C. Both 1 and 2
D. Neither 1 nor 2
Explanation - Answer is B.
Consultative committees are attached to various
ministries/departments of the Central Government.

They consist of members of both the Houses of Parliament.
The Minister/Minister of State in charge of the Ministry concerned
acts as the chairman of the consultative committee of that ministry.
These committees provide a forum for informal discussions between
the ministers and the members of Parliament on policies and
programmes of the government and the manner of their
implementation.
These committees are constituted by the Ministry of Parliamentary
Affairs.
The guidelines regarding the composition, functions and procedures of
these committees are formulated by this Ministry.

The Ministry also makes arrangements for holding their meetings both
during the session and the intersession period of Parliament.
The membership of these committees is voluntary and is left to the
choice of the members and the leaders of their parties.
The maximum membership of a committee is 30 and the minimum is 10.
These committees are normally constituted after the new Lok Sabha is
constituted, after General Elections for the Lok Sabha.
Thus, these committees shall stand dissolved upon dissolution of every
Lok Sabha and shall be reconstituted upon constitution of each Lok
Sabha.

Also, separate Informal Consultative Committees of the members of
Parliament are also constituted for all the Railway Zones.
Members of Parliament belonging to the area falling under a particular
Railway Zone are nominated on the Informal Consultative Committee of
that Railway Zone.
Unlike the Consultative Committees attached to various
ministries/departments, the meetings of the Informal Consultative
Committees are to be arranged during the session periods only.


Q5: Which of the following is/are true regarding Committee on
Public Undertakings?
1) It was created on the recommendation of the Krishna Menon
Committee.

2) Members from Rajya Sabha cannot become chairman of the
committee.
A. Only 1
B. Only 2
C. Both 1 and 2
D. Neither 1 nor 2
Explanation - Answer is C.
This committee was created in 1964 on the recommendation of the
Krishna Menon Committee.
Originally, it had 15 members (10 from the Lok Sabha and 5 from the
Rajya Sabha).
In1974, its membership was raised to 22 (15 from the Lok Sabha and 7
from the Rajya Sabha).

The members of this committee are elected by the Parliament every
year from amongst its own members according to the principle of
proportional representation by means of a single transferable vote.
Thus,all parties get due representation in it.
The term of office of the members is one year.
A minister cannot be elected as a member of the committee.
The chairman of the committee is appointed by the Speaker from
amongst its members who are drawn from the Lok Sabha only.

Thus, the members of the committee who are from the Rajya Sabha
cannot be appointed as the chairman.
Functions -
1. To examine the reports and accounts of public undertakings.
2. To examine the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General on
public undertakings.
3. To examine (in the context of autonomy and efficiency of public
undertakings) whether the affairs of the public undertakings are being
managed in accordance with sound business principles and prudent
commercial practices.
4. To exercise such other functions vested in the public accounts
committee and the Estimates Committee in relation to public
undertakings which are allotted to it by the Speaker from time-totime.

The committee cannot examine and investigate -
1. Matters of major government policy as distinct from business or
commercial functions of the public undertakings.
2. Matters of day-to-day administration.
3. Matters for the consideration of which machinery is established by
any special statute under which a particular public undertaking is
established.
Effectiveness of the committee is limited by -
1. It cannot take up the examination of more than ten to twelve public
undertakings in a year.
2. Its work is in the nature of a post-mortem.
3. It does not look into technical matters as its members are not
technical experts.

4. Its recommendations are advisory and not binding on the ministries.


Q6: Which of the following are true regarding the composition of
Departmental Standing Committees?
1) They were setup in 1993.
2) Each committee consists of 31 members.
3) Its recommendations are advisory.
A. 1, 2
B. 1, 3
C. 2, 3
D. All of the above
Explanation - Answer is D.
On the recommendation of the Rules Committee of the Lok Sabha, 17
Departmentally-Related Standing Committees (DRSCs) were set up in
the Parliament in 1993.

In 2004, number was increased from 17 to 24.
The main objective of the standing committees is to secure more
accountability of the Executive (i.e., the Council of Ministers) to the
Parliament, particularly financial accountability.
They also assist the Parliament in debating the budget more
effectively.
The 24 standing committees cover under their jurisdiction all the
ministries/departments of the Central Government.
In 1989, three Standing Committees were constituted which dealt with
Agriculture, Science and Technology and Environment and Forests.

In 1993, they were superseded by the Departmentally-Related
Standing Committees (DRSCs).
Each standing committee consists of 31 members (21 from Lok Sabha
and 10 from Rajya Sabha).
The members of the Lok Sabha are nominated by the Speaker from
amongst its own members, just as the members of the Rajya Sabha are
nominated by the Chairman from amongst its members.
A minister is not eligible to be nominated as a member of any of the
standing committees.

In case a member, after his nomination to any of the standing
committees, is appointed a minister, he then ceases to be a member of
the committee.
The term of office of each standing committee is one year from the
date of its constitution.
Out of the 24 standing committees, 8 work under the Rajya Sabha and
16 under the Lok Sabha.
Functions -
1. To consider the demands for grants of the concerned
ministries/departments before they are discussed and voted in the Lok
Sabha. Its report should not suggest anything of the nature of cut
motions.

2. To examine bills pertaining to the concerned
ministries/departments.
3. To consider annual reports of ministries/departments.
4. To consider national basic long-term policy documents presented to
the Houses.
Limitations on the functioning of standing committees are -
1. They should not consider the matters of day-to-day administration
of the concerned ministries/departments.
2. They should not generally consider the matters which are considered
by other parliamentary committees.
3. It should be noted here that the recommendations of these
committees are advisory in nature and hence not binding on the
Parliament.


Q7: Which of the following is/are true?

1) Constitution of India does not mention Parliamentary Privileges
specifically in any articles.
2) There may be contempt of the House without committing a breach
of privilege.
A. Only 1
B. Only 2
C. Both 1 and 2
D. Neither 1 nor 2
Explanation - Answer is B.
Any act or omission which obstructs a House of Parliament, its member
or its officer in the performance of their functions or which has a
tendency, directly or indirectly to produce results against the dignity,
authority and honor of the House is treated as contempt of the House.
Though the two phrases, ‘breach of privilege’ and ‘contempt of the
House’ are used interchangeably, they have different implications.

Normally, a breach of privilege may amount to contempt of the House.
Contempt of the House, however, has wider implications.
There may be contempt of the House without specifically committing a
breach of privilege.
Sources of Privileges -
Originally, the Constitution (Article 105) explicitly mentions two
privileges, that is, freedom of speech in Parliament and right of
publication of its proceedings.

With regard to other privileges, it provided that they were to be the
same as those of the British House of Commons, its committees and its
members on the date of its commencement (i.e., 26 January, 1950),
until defined by Parliament.
The 44thAmendment Act of 1978 provided that the other privileges of
each House of Parliament, its committees and its members are to be
those which they had on the date of its commencement (i.e., 20 June,
1979), until defined by Parliament.
The amendment has made only verbal changes by dropping a direct
reference to the British House of Commons, without making any change
in the implication of the provision.


Q8: Which of the following are legislative and executive powers
and functions of the Parliament?
1) Parliament can make laws on the subjects enumerated in the State
List.

2) Parliament exercises control over the Executive through questionhour.
3) Lok Sabha can express lack of confidence in the government by no
confidence motion.
4) It can recommend removal of judges.
a. 1, 2, 3
b. 2, 4
c. 2, 3
d. All of the above
Explanation - Answer is C.
Legislative Powers and Functions -
The primary function of Parliament is to make laws for the governance
of the country.

It has exclusive power to make laws on the subjects in the Union List
(which at present has 100 subjects, originally 97 subjects) and on the
residuary subjects (that is, subjects not enumerated in any of the 3
lists).
With regard to Concurrent List (which has at present 52 subjects,
originally 47 subjects), the Parliament has overriding powers, i.e. the
law of Parliament prevails over the law of the state legislature in case
of a conflict between the two.
The Constitution also empowers the Parliament to make laws on the
subjects enumerated in the State List under the following 5 abnormal
circumstances -
1. When Rajya Sabha passes a resolution to that effect.
2. When a proclamation of National Emergency is in operation.
3. When two or more states make a joint request to the Parliament.

4. When necessary to give effect to international agreements, treaties
and conventions.
5. When President’s Rule is in operation in the state.
All the ordinances issued by the president (during the recess of the
Parliament) must be approved by the Parliament within six weeks after
its reassembly.
An ordinance becomes inoperative if it is not approved by the
parliament within that period.
The Parliament makes laws in a skeleton form and authorises the
Executive to make detailed rules and regulations within the framework
of the parent law.

This is known as delegated legislation or executive legislation or
subordinate legislation. Such rules and regulations are placed before
the Parliament for its examination.
Executive Powers and Functions -
The Executive is responsible to the Parliament for its policies and acts.
The Parliament exercises control over the Executive through questionhour, zero hour, half-an-hour discussion, short duration discussion,
calling attention motion, adjournment motion, no-confidence motion,
censure motion and other discussions.
It also supervises the activities of the Executive with the help of its
committees.

The ministers are collectively responsible to the Parliament in general
and to the Lok Sabha in particular.
As a part of collective responsibility, there is individual responsibility,
that is, each minister is individually responsible for the efficient
administration of the ministry under his charge.
The council of ministers can be removed from office by the Lok Sabha
by passing a no-confidence motion.
The Lok Sabha can also express lack of confidence in the government
in the following ways -
1. By not passing a motion of thanks on the President’s inaugural
address.
2. By rejecting a money bill.

3. By passing a censure motion or an adjournment motion.
4. By defeating the government on a vital issue.
5. By passing a cut motion.
Therefore, “the first function of Parliament can be said to be to select
the group which is to form the government, support and sustain it in
power so long as it enjoys its confidence, and to expel it when it ceases
to do so, and leave it to the people to decide at the next general
election.”


Q9: Which of the following is/are true regarding Youth Parliament?
1) UNESCO and National Commission for Child Rights recommended for

2) The ministry of Parliamentary Affairs provides necessary training
related to the scheme.

a. Only 1
b. Only 2
c. Both 1 and 2
d. Neither 1 nor 2
Explanation - Answer is B.
The scheme of Youth Parliament was started on the recommendation of
the Fourth All India Whips Conference.
Its objectives are -
1. To acquaint the younger generations with practices and procedures
of Parliament.
2. To imbibe the spirit of discipline and tolerance cultivating character
in the minds of youth.

3. To inculcate in the student community the basic values of democracy
and to enable them to acquire a proper perspective on the functioning
of democratic institutions.
The ministry of parliamentary affairs provides necessary training and
encouragement to the states in introducing the scheme.
The idea of organizing “Youth Parliaments’ in educational institutions
was conceived by the Fourth All India Whips Conference held at
Bombay in 1962 which made, inter-alia, the following recommendation -
“This Committee recommends that Government should encourage
holding of Mock Parliament in educational institutions and through
Panchayats in rural areas.”
The scheme wishes to strengthen the roots of democracy, inculcate
healthy habits of discipline, tolerance of views of others and to enable
the student community to have better awareness about the working of
Parliament.

The scheme gives financial assistance to the State
Governments/Governments of Union Territories to organize similar
competitions in their recognized schools.

It doesn’t differentiate between defection and dissent.
It curtails the legislator’s right to dissent and freedom of conscience.
Thus, it clearly puts party bossism on a pedestal and sanctions tyranny
of the party in the name of the party discipline.
The difference it accords to individual defection and group defection
is irrational.
Thus ‘it banned only retail defections and legalized wholesale
defections’.www.achieveias.co.in, YouTube Channel: http://youtube.com/c/AchieveIAS Telegram

It does not consider the expulsion of a legislator from his party for his
activities outside the legislature.
The discrimination it undertakes between an independent member and
a nominated member is illogical. For both the rules are different.
Giving the decision-making authority to presiding officer is criticized
because he may not exercise this authority in an impartial and
objective manner.
Also, the officer lacks the legal knowledge and experience to
adjudicate upon the cases.www.achieveias.co.in, YouTube Channel: http://youtube.com/c/AchieveIAS Telegram
