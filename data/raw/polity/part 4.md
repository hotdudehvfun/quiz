        `@ B. 2 only `,
        `@ C. Both of them `,
        `@ D. Neither of them `,
    ],




    answer: `Answer: C`,
    exp: `Explanation - Answer is C. Article 76 provides for the office of the Attorney General for India who is the highest law officer in the country. Appointment and Term of the Attorney General - The Attorney General (AG) is appointed by the President.  He must be a person who is qualified to be appointed a judge of the Supreme Court. That means, he must be a citizen of India and he must have been a judge of some High Court for five years or an advocate of some High Court for ten years or an eminent jurist, in the opinion of the President. The term of office of the AG is not fixed by the Constitution. Also, the Constitution does not contain the procedure and grounds for his removal. He holds office during the pleasure of the President. Thus, he may be removed by the President at any time. He may also quit his office by submitting his resignation to the President.  Conventionally, he resigns when the government (Council of Ministers) resigns or is replaced. This is because he is appointed on the government’s advice. The remuneration of the AG is not fixed by the constitution and receives such remuneration as the President may decide. Solicitor General of India - Apart from AG, there are other law officers of the Government of India. They are the solicitor general of India and additional solicitor general of India. They assist the AG in the fulfilment of his official responsibilities. Only the office of the AG is created by the constitution.  Article 76 does not mention about the solicitor general and additional solicitor general. The AG is not a member of the central cabinet. There is a separate law minister in the central cabinet to look after legal matters at the government level.   `,

        `@ B. Only 2 `,
        `@ C. Both 1 and 2 `,
        `@ D. Neither 1 nor 2 `,
    ],




    answer: `Answer: B`,
    exp: `Explanation - Answer is B. Role of CAG - CAG makes sure that executive are responsible to the Parliament in the area of financial administration. CAG undertakes audit of expenditure on behalf of the Parliament and hence is an agent of Parliament. CAG is responsible only to the Parliament. Along with legal and regulatory audit, CAG can also conduct propriety audit.  Propriety Audit is seeing that government expenditure follows ‘wisdom, faithfulness and economy’. If not, CAG can comment on the wastage and extravagance of such expenditure. While legal and regulatory audit is mandatory for CAG, the propriety audit is discretionary. CAG cannot ask for details of secret service expenditure. He has to just accept a certificate from administrative authority which says that the said expenditure has been incurred. The Constitution of India sees CAG to be Comptroller as well as Auditor General. But the CAG has no control over the issue of money from the consolidated fund and many departments are authorised to draw money by issuing cheques without specific authority from the CAG, who is  concerned only at the audit stage when the expenditure has already taken place. Thus he is just Auditor General and not a Comptroller. But CAG of Britain has both powers of being Comptroller as well as Auditor General.   `,

Japanese Constitution is, perhaps, the only democratic Constitution in world which contains a list of duties of citizens.  The socialist countries, on the contrary, gave equal importance to the fundamental rights and duties of their citizens. Hence, the Constitution of erstwhile USSR declared that the citizen's exercise of their rights and freedoms was inseparable from the performance of their duties and obligations.   `,

    answer: `Answer: A`,
    exp: `Explanation - Answer is A. The functions of the Parliament are varied, complex and voluminous. It has neither the adequate time nor necessary expertise to make a detailed scrutiny of all legislative measures and other matters. Hence, it is assisted by a number of committees in the discharge of its duties.  The Constitution of India mentions these committees, but without any specific provisions regarding their composition, tenure, functions etc. All these matters are dealt by the rules of two Houses. Accordingly, a parliamentary committee means a committee that - A. Is appointed or elected by the House or nominated by the Speaker/Chairman 1. B. Works under the direction of the Speaker/Chairman. C. Presents its report to the House or to the Speaker/Chairman. D. Has a secretariat provided by the Lok Sabha/Rajya Sabha.  The consultative committees, which also consist of members of Parliament, are not parliamentary committees as they do not fulfill above four conditions. A Minister is not eligible for election or nomination to the Financial Committees, Departmental Standing Committees, Committees on Empowerment of Women, Government Assurances, Petitions, Subordinate Legislation and Welfare of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. Broadly, Parliamentary Committees are of 2 types - Standing Committees and Ad Hoc Committees. Standing Committees are permanent (constituted every year or periodically) and work on a continuous basis.  Ad hoc Committees are temporary and cease to exist on completion of the task assigned to them. Standing Committees - On basis of the nature of functions, standing committees can be classified into six categories - 1. Financial Committees - A. Public Accounts Committee. B. Estimates Committee. C. Committee on Public Undertakings. 2. Departmental Standing Committees (24 in number). 3. Committees to Inquire -  A. Committee on Petitions. B. Committee of Privileges. C. Ethics Committee. 4. Committees to Scrutinize and Control- A. Committee on Government Assurances. B. Committee on Subordinate Legislation. C. Committee on Papers Laid on the Table. D. Committee on Welfare of SCs and Sts. (e) Committee on Empowerment of Women. (f) Joint Committee on Offices of Profit.  5. Committees Relating to the Day-to-Day Business of the House - A. Business Advisory Committee. B.

        `@ B. Only 2 `,
        `@ C. Both 1 and 2 `,
        `@ D. Neither 1 nor 2 `,
    ],




    answer: `Answer: B`,
    exp: `Explanation - Answer is B. Consultative committees are attached to various ministries/departments of the Central Government.  They consist of members of both the Houses of Parliament. The Minister/Minister of State in charge of the Ministry concerned acts as the chairman of the consultative committee of that ministry. These committees provide a forum for informal discussions between the ministers and the members of Parliament on policies and programmes of the government and the manner of their implementation. These committees are constituted by the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs. The guidelines regarding the composition, functions and procedures of these committees are formulated by this Ministry.  The Ministry also makes arrangements for holding their meetings both during the session and the intersession period of Parliament. The membership of these committees is voluntary and is left to the choice of the members and the leaders of their parties. The maximum membership of a committee is 30 and the minimum is 10. These committees are normally constituted after the new Lok Sabha is constituted, after General Elections for the Lok Sabha. Thus, these committees shall stand dissolved upon dissolution of every Lok Sabha and shall be reconstituted upon constitution of each Lok Sabha.  Also, separate Informal Consultative Committees of the members of Parliament are also constituted for all the Railway Zones. Members of Parliament belonging to the area falling under a particular Railway Zone are nominated on the Informal Consultative Committee of that Railway Zone. Unlike the Consultative Committees attached to various ministries/departments, the meetings of the Informal Consultative Committees are to be arranged during the session periods only.   `,

        `@ C. Both 1 and 2 `,
        `@ D. Neither 1 nor 2 `,
    ],




    answer: `Answer: C`,
    exp: `Explanation - Answer is C. This committee was created in 1964 on the recommendation of the Krishna Menon Committee. Originally, it had 15 members (10 from the Lok Sabha and 5 from the Rajya Sabha). In1974, its membership was raised to 22 (15 from the Lok Sabha and 7 from the Rajya Sabha).  The members of this committee are elected by the Parliament every year from amongst its own members according to the principle of proportional representation by means of a single transferable vote. Thus,all parties get due representation in it. The term of office of the members is one year. A minister cannot be elected as a member of the committee. The chairman of the committee is appointed by the Speaker from amongst its members who are drawn from the Lok Sabha only.  Thus, the members of the committee who are from the Rajya Sabha cannot be appointed as the chairman. Functions - 1. To examine the reports and accounts of public undertakings. 2. To examine the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General on public undertakings. 3. To examine (in the context of autonomy and efficiency of public undertakings) whether the affairs of the public undertakings are being managed in accordance with sound business principles and prudent commercial practices. 4. To exercise such other functions vested in the public accounts committee and the Estimates Committee in relation to public undertakings which are allotted to it by the Speaker from time-totime.  The committee cannot examine and investigate - 1. Matters of major government policy as distinct from business or commercial functions of the public undertakings. 2. Matters of day-to-day administration. 3. Matters for the consideration of which machinery is established by any special statute under which a particular public undertaking is established. Effectiveness of the committee is limited by - 1. It cannot take up the examination of more than ten to twelve public undertakings in a year. 2. Its work is in the nature of a post-mortem. 3. It does not look into technical matters as its members are not technical experts.  4. Its recommendations are advisory and not binding on the ministries.   `,

    answer: `Answer: D`,
    exp: `Explanation - Answer is D. On the recommendation of the Rules Committee of the Lok Sabha, 17 Departmentally-Related Standing Committees (DRSCs) were set up in the Parliament in 1993.  In 2004, number was increased from 17 to 24. The main objective of the standing committees is to secure more accountability of the Executive (i.e., the Council of Ministers) to the Parliament, particularly financial accountability. They also assist the Parliament in debating the budget more effectively. The 24 standing committees cover under their jurisdiction all the ministries/departments of the Central Government. In 1989, three Standing Committees were constituted which dealt with Agriculture, Science and Technology and Environment and Forests.  In 1993, they were superseded by the Departmentally-Related Standing Committees (DRSCs). Each standing committee consists of 31 members (21 from Lok Sabha and 10 from Rajya Sabha). The members of the Lok Sabha are nominated by the Speaker from amongst its own members, just as the members of the Rajya Sabha are nominated by the Chairman from amongst its members. A minister is not eligible to be nominated as a member of any of the standing committees.  In case a member, after his nomination to any of the standing committees, is appointed a minister, he then ceases to be a member of the committee. The term of office of each standing committee is one year from the date of its constitution. Out of the 24 standing committees, 8 work under the Rajya Sabha and 16 under the Lok Sabha. Functions - 1. To consider the demands for grants of the concerned ministries/departments before they are discussed and voted in the Lok Sabha. Its report should not suggest anything of the nature of cut motions.  2. To examine bills pertaining to the concerned ministries/departments. 3. To consider annual reports of ministries/departments. 4. To consider national basic long-term policy documents presented to the Houses. Limitations on the functioning of standing committees are - 1. They should not consider the matters of day-to-day administration of the concerned ministries/departments. 2. They should not generally consider the matters which are considered by other parliamentary committees. 3. It should be noted here that the recommendations of these committees are advisory in nature and hence not binding on the Parliament.   `,

    question: `# Which of the following is/are true?  1) Constitution of India does not mention Parliamentary Privileges specifically in any articles. 2) There may be contempt of the House without committing a breach of privilege. `,

        `@ A. Only 1 `,
        `@ B. Only 2 `,
        `@ C. Both 1 and 2 `,
        `@ D. Neither 1 nor 2 `,
    ],




    answer: `Answer: B`,
    exp: `Explanation - Answer is B. Any act or omission which obstructs a House of Parliament, its member or its officer in the performance of their functions or which has a tendency, directly or indirectly to produce results against the dignity, authority and honor of the House is treated as contempt of the House. Though the two phrases, ‘breach of privilege’ and ‘contempt of the House’ are used interchangeably, they have different implications.  Normally, a breach of privilege may amount to contempt of the House. Contempt of the House, however, has wider implications. There may be contempt of the House without specifically committing a breach of privilege. Sources of Privileges - Originally, the Constitution (Article 105) explicitly mentions two privileges, that is, freedom of speech in Parliament and right of publication of its proceedings.  With regard to other privileges, it provided that they were to be the same as those of the British House of Commons, its committees and its members on the date of its commencement (i.e., 26 January, 1950), until defined by Parliament. The 44thAmendment Act of 1978 provided that the other privileges of each House of Parliament, its committees and its members are to be those which they had on the date of its commencement (i.e., 20 June, 1979), until defined by Parliament. The amendment has made only verbal changes by dropping a direct reference to the British House of Commons, without making any change in the implication of the provision.   `,

        `@ C. 2, 3 `,
        `@ D. All of the above `,
    ],




    answer: `Answer: C`,
    exp: `Explanation - Answer is C. Legislative Powers and Functions - The primary function of Parliament is to make laws for the governance of the country.  It has exclusive power to make laws on the subjects in the Union List (which at present has 100 subjects, originally 97 subjects) and on the residuary subjects (that is, subjects not enumerated in any of the 3 lists). With regard to Concurrent List (which has at present 52 subjects, originally 47 subjects), the Parliament has overriding powers, i.e. the law of Parliament prevails over the law of the state legislature in case of a conflict between the two. The Constitution also empowers the Parliament to make laws on the subjects enumerated in the State List under the following 5 abnormal circumstances - 1. When Rajya Sabha passes a resolution to that effect. 2. When a proclamation of National Emergency is in operation. 3. When two or more states make a joint request to the Parliament.  4. When necessary to give effect to international agreements, treaties and conventions. 5. When President’s Rule is in operation in the state. All the ordinances issued by the president (during the recess of the Parliament) must be approved by the Parliament within six weeks after its reassembly. An ordinance becomes inoperative if it is not approved by the parliament within that period. The Parliament makes laws in a skeleton form and authorises the Executive to make detailed rules and regulations within the framework of the parent law.  This is known as delegated legislation or executive legislation or subordinate legislation. Such rules and regulations are placed before the Parliament for its examination. Executive Powers and Functions - The Executive is responsible to the Parliament for its policies and acts. The Parliament exercises control over the Executive through questionhour, zero hour, half-an-hour discussion, short duration discussion, calling attention motion, adjournment motion, no-confidence motion, censure motion and other discussions. It also supervises the activities of the Executive with the help of its committees.  The ministers are collectively responsible to the Parliament in general and to the Lok Sabha in particular. As a part of collective responsibility, there is individual responsibility, that is, each minister is individually responsible for the efficient administration of the ministry under his charge. The council of ministers can be removed from office by the Lok Sabha by passing a no-confidence motion. The Lok Sabha can also express lack of confidence in the government in the following ways - 1. By not passing a motion of thanks on the President’s inaugural address. 2. By rejecting a money bill.  3. By passing a censure motion or an adjournment motion. 4. By defeating the government on a vital issue. 5. By passing a cut motion. Therefore, “the first function of Parliament can be said to be to select the group which is to form the government, support and sustain it in power so long as it enjoys its confidence, and to expel it when it ceases to do so, and leave it to the people to decide at the next general election.”   `,

To acquaint the younger generations with practices and procedures of Parliament. 2. To imbibe the spirit of discipline and tolerance cultivating character in the minds of youth.  3. To inculcate in the student community the basic values of democracy and to enable them to acquire a proper perspective on the functioning of democratic institutions. The ministry of parliamentary affairs provides necessary training and encouragement to the states in introducing the scheme. The idea of organizing “Youth Parliaments’ in educational institutions was conceived by the Fourth All India Whips Conference held at Bombay in 1962 which made, inter-alia, the following recommendation - “This Committee recommends that Government should encourage holding of Mock Parliament in educational institutions and through Panchayats in rural areas.” The scheme wishes to strengthen the roots of democracy, inculcate healthy habits of discipline, tolerance of views of others and to enable the student community to have better awareness about the working of Parliament.  The scheme gives financial assistance to the State Governments/Governments of Union Territories to organize similar competitions in their recognized schools.   `,

In other words, the State should not spend the public money collected by way of tax for the promotion or maintenance of any particular religion.

On the other hand, a remedy under Article 226 is discretionary and hence, a high court may refuse to exercise its writ jurisdiction. Article 32 does not merely confer power on the Supreme Court as Article 226 does on a high court to issue writs for the enforcement of fundamental rights or other rights as part of its general jurisdiction. The Supreme Court is thus constituted as a defender and guarantor of the fundamental rights.   `,

    answer: `Answer: D`,
    exp: `Explanation - Answer is D. Merits of the Anti-Defection Law - 1. It checks mischief of defection by checking tendencies of legislators to change parties. 2. This brings greater stability in the legislature. 3. It facilitates democratic realignment of parties in the legislature in the form of merger of parties. 4. It drastically reduces expenditure incurred on irregular elections as well as corruption at the political level. 5. For the first time a proper and clear constitutional recognition is provided to political parties. Criticism of Anti-Defection Law - It doesn’t differentiate between defection and dissent. It curtails the legislator’s right to dissent and freedom of conscience. Thus, it clearly puts party bossism on a pedestal and sanctions tyranny of the party in the name of the party discipline. The difference it accords to individual defection and group defection is irrational. Thus ‘it banned only retail defections and legalized wholesale defections’. It does not consider the expulsion of a legislator from his party for his activities outside the legislature. The discrimination it undertakes between an independent member and a nominated member is illogical. For both the rules are different. Giving the decision-making authority to presiding officer is criticized because he may not exercise this authority in an impartial and objective manner. Also, the officer lacks the legal knowledge and experience to adjudicate upon the cases.   `,

    ],




    answer: `Answer: A`,
    exp: `Explanation - Answer is A. The princely states were merged with Indian states on ad hoc basis. Many sections were demanding reorganization of states on the basis of language. Hence, in 1948, the Government of India appointed a Commission under the chairmanship of SK Dhar to examine the feasibility of reorgansation of states on the basis of language.  The commission recommended the reorganisation of states on the basis of administrative convenience rather than language. The recommendation of commission created resentment among many sections. Hence, in 1948, one more committee was appointed comprising of Jawaharlal Nehru, Vallahbhai Patel and Pattabhi Sitaramayya, popularly known as JVP Committee. It also rejected language as the basis for reorganisation of states. In 1953, a three-member States Reorganisation Commission under the chairmanship of Fazl Ali was appointed to re-examine the demand of reorganization of states on the basis of language. The commission broadly accepted language as the basis of reorganisation of states.    `,
