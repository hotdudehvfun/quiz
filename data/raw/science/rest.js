    ],
    answer: `Answer: B`,
    exp: `Explanation: Our stomach produces hydrochloric acid. It helps in digestion of food without harming the stomach. During indigestion, the stomach produces too much acid and this causes pain and irritation. To get rid of this pain, people use bases called antacids. These antacids neutralise the excess acid. Magnesium hydroxide (Milk of magnesia), a mild base, is often used for this purpose. `

    ],
    answer: `Answer: A`,
    exp: `Explanation: Our body works within the pH range of 7.0 to 7.8. Living organisms can survive only in a narrow range of pH change. When pH of rain water is less than 5.6, it is called acid rain. When acid rain flows into the rivers, it lowers the pH of the river water. The survival of aquatic life in such rivers becomes difficult. Tooth decay starts when pH of the mouth is lower than 5.5. Tooth enamel, made up of calcium phosphate is the hardest substance in the body. It does not dissolve in water, but gets corroded when the pH level in the mouth goes below 5.5. Using toothpastes, which are generally basic, for cleaning the teeth can neutralise the excess acid and thus can prevent tooth decay . `

    answer: `Answer: D`,
    exp: `Explanation: Anodising is a process of forming a thick oxide layer of aluminium. Aluminium develops a thin oxide layer when exposed to air. This aluminium oxide coat makes it resistant to further corrosion. The resistance can be improved further by making the oxide layer thicker. During anodising, a clean aluminium article is made the anode and is electrolysed with dilute sulphuric acid. The oxygen gas evolved at the anode reacts with aluminium to make a thicker protective oxide layer. This oxide layer can be dyed easily to give aluminium articles an attractive finish. `

    ],
    answer: `Answer: B`,
    exp: `Explanation: The bonds which are formed by the sharing of an electron pair between two atoms are known as covalent bonds. Since the electrons are shared between atoms and no charged particles are formed, such covalent compounds are generally poor conductors of electricity as they do not have a free electron to move. Covalently bonded molecules are seen to have strong bonds within the molecule, but intermolecular forces are small. This gives rise to the low melting and boiling points of these compounds. `

        'C. Consumption of ethanol tends to slow metabolic processes. ',
        'D. Ethanol is a liquid at room temperature. ',
    ],
    answer: `Answer: B`,
    exp: `Explanation: Ethanol is a good solvent, it is also used in medicines such as tincture iodine, cough syrups, and many tonics. When large quantities of ethanol are consumed, it tends to depress the central nervous system. This results in lack of coordination, mental confusion, drowsiness, lowering of the normal inhibitions, and finally stupor. Consumption of ethanol tends to slow metabolic process. Alcohol contains empty calories and has no nutritional value. It often contributes to malnutrition because the high levels of calories in most alcoholic drinks can account for a large percentage of your daily energy requirementsEthanol is liquid at room temperature. Ethanol is commonly called alcohol and is the active ingredient of all alcoholic drinks. `

    answer: `Answer: C`,
    exp: `Explanation: Sugarcane plants are one of the most efficient convertors of sunlight into chemical energy. Sugarcane juice is used to prepare molasses which is fermented to give alcohol (ethanol). Some countries now use alcohol as an additive in petrol since it is a cleaner fuel which gives rise to only carbon dioxide and water on burning in sufficient air (oxygen). As the Alcohol molecule contains oxygen, it allows the engine to more completely combust the fuel, resulting in fewer emissions and thereby reducing the occurrence of environmental pollution. Since alcohol is produced from plants that harness the power of the sun, it is also considered as renewable fuel. `

        'C. Carboxylic acid ',
        'D. Sodium hydroxide ',
    ],
    answer: `Answer: B`,
    exp: `Explanation: Bathing foam forms an insoluble substance (scum), this is caused by the reaction of soap with the calcium and magnesium salts, which cause the hardness of water. This problem is overcome by using another class of compounds called detergents as cleansing agents. Detergents are generally ammonium or sulphonate salts of long chain carboxylic acids. The charged ends of these compounds do not form insoluble precipitates with the calcium and magnesium ions in hard water. Thus, they remain effective in hard water. Detergents are usually used to make shampoos and products for cleaning clothes. `

        'D. A-2 B-3 C-4 D-1 ',
    ],
    answer: `Answer: B`,
    exp: `Explanation: In the year 1817, Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner, a German chemist, tried to arrange the elements with similar properties into groups. He identified some groups having three elements each. So he called these groups 'triads'. In 1866, John Newlands, an English scientist arranged the then known elements in the order of increasing atomic masses. He compared the table to the octaves found in music. Therefore, he called it the ‘Law of Octaves’. The main credit for classifying elements goes to Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeléev, a Russian chemist. He was the most important contributor to the early development of a Periodic Table of elements wherein the elements were arranged on the basis of their fundamental property, the atomic mass, and also on the similarity of chemical properties. In 1913, Henry Moseley showed that the atomic number of an element is a more fundamental property than its atomic mass as described below. Accordingly, Mendeléev’s Periodic Law was modified and atomic number was adopted as the basis of Modern Periodic Table. `

        'C. Both 1 and 2 ',
        'D. Neither 1 nor 2 ',
    ],
    answer: `Answer: C`,
    exp: `Explanation: Mendeleev examined the relationship between the atomic masses of the elements and their physical and chemical properties. He observed that most of the elements got a place in a Periodic Table and were arranged in the order of their increasing atomic masses. It was also observed that there occurs a periodic recurrence of elements with similar physical and chemical properties. Mendeléev left some gaps in his Periodic Table. Instead of looking upon these gaps as defects, Mendeléev boldly predicted the existence of some elements that had not been discovered at that time. `

        'C. 1 and 3 only ',
        'D. 1, 2 and 3 ',
    ],
    answer: `Answer: D`,
    exp: `Explanation: Certainly, no fixed position can be given to hydrogen in the Periodic Table. This was the first limitation of Mendeléev’s Periodic Table. He could not assign a correct position to hydrogen in his Table. Isotopes were discovered long after Mendeléev had proposed his periodic classification of elements. Isotopes of an element have similar chemical properties, but different atomic masses. Thus, isotopes of all elements posed a challenge to Mendeleev’s Periodic Law. Another problem was that the atomic masses do not increase in a regular manner in going from one element to the next. So it was not possible to predict how many elements could be discovered between two elements — especially when we consider the heavier elements. `

        'C. Both 1 and 2 ',
        'D. Neither 1 nor 2 ',
    ],
    answer: `Answer: A`,
    exp: `Explanation:  The Modern Periodic Law states: 'Properties of elements are a periodic function of their atomic number'.  The atomic number gives us the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom and this number increases by one in going from one element to the next.  Elements, when arranged in order of increasing atomic number Z, lead us to the classification known as the Modern Periodic Table.  Prediction of properties of elements could be made with more precision when elements were arranged on the basis of increasing atomic number.  The Modern Periodic Table has 18 vertical columns known as ‘groups’ and 7 horizontal rows known as ‘periods’. `

    question: `#10. Regarding the modern periodic table, which of the following statements is incorrect? `,
    options: [
        'A. The elements present in any one group have the same number of valence electrons. ',
        'B. Each valence shell indicates that the outer shell is filled with electrons. ',
        'C. The atomic radius decreases in moving from left to right along a period, whereas the atomic size increases down the group. ',
        'D. Metallic character increases across a period and decreases down a group. ',
    ],
    answer: `Answer: D`,
    exp: `Explanation: As the effective nuclear charge acting on the valence shell electrons increases across a period, the tendency to lose electrons will decrease. Down the group, the effective nuclear charge experienced by valence electrons is decreasing because the outermost electrons are farther away from the nucleus. Therefore, these can be lost easily. Hence metallic character decreases across a period and increases down a group. `

    exp: `Explanation: Different plant hormones help to coordinate growth, development and responses to the environment. They are synthesised at places away from where they act and simply diffuse to the area of action. 1. When growing plants detect light, a hormone called Auxin, synthesised at the shoot tip, helps the cells to grow longer. 2. Another example of plant hormones are Gibberellins which, help in the growth of the stem. 3. Cytokinins promote cell division, and it is natural that they are present in greater concentration in areas of rapid cell division, such as in fruits and seeds. These are examples of plant hormones that help in promoting growth. 4. But plants also need signals to stop growing. Abscisic acid is one example of a hormone which inhibits growth.

    answer: `Answer: A`,
    exp: `Explanation:  Adrenaline is secreted directly into the blood and carried to different parts of the body and is known as "fight or flight" Hormone.  The target organs or the specific tissues on which it acts include the heart. As a result, the heart beats faster, resulting in supply of more oxygen to our muscles.  The blood to the digestive system and skin is reduced due to contraction of muscles around small arteries in these organs. This diverts the blood to our skeletal muscles.  The breathing rate also increases because of the contractions of the diaphragm and the rib muscles.  All these responses together enable the animal body to be ready to deal with the situations like fighting and running.  Testosterone and estrogen are the reproductive hormones such animal hormones are part of the endocrine system which constitutes a second way of control and coordination in our body. `

    answer: `Answer: B`,
    exp: `Explanation: In anaerobic respiration, there is a lack of oxygen in our muscles. Pyruvate instead of breaking down to form carbondioxide and water, it disintegrates into lactic acid and its accumulation in our muscles leads to cramps. Aquatic organisms breathe much faster than terrestrial organisms as the amount of oxygen dissolved in water is less as compared to the amount of oxygen in air. To compensate this, breathing rate of aquatic organisms is faster. `

    answer: `Answer: D`,
    exp: `Explanation: Carbon and energy requirements of an autotrophic organism are fulfilled by photosynthesis. It is the process by which autotrophs take in substances from the outside and convert them into stored forms of energy. This material is taken in the form of carbon dioxide and water which is then converted into carbohydrates, in the presence of sunlight and chlorophyll. The carbohydrates which are not used immediately are stored in the form of starch, which serves as the internal energy reserve to be used as and when required by the plant. Hence, Statement 1 is not Correct. The energy derived from the food human beings eat, is stored in their body in the form of glycogen.`

    question: `#7. Consider the following events about Photosynthesis: \n 1. Absorption of light energy by chlorophyll. \n 2. Reduction of carbon dioxide to carbohydrates. \n Which of the statements given above is/are correct? `,
    options: [
        'A. 1 only ',
        'B. 2 only ',
        'C. Both 1 and 2 ',
        'D. Neither 1 nor 2 ',
    ],
    answer: `Answer: C`,
    exp: `Explanation: Photosynthesis is a process by which plants converts inorganic materials such as carbon dioxide and oxygen into carbohydrates using sunlight. This process occurs in the chloroplast of plants. Chlorophyll traps the sunlight to reduce carbon dioxide and water into oxygen and Glucose which allows the plant to grow. Hence, Statement 1 and 2 are Correct. Water splits into oxygen, hydrogen ions, and electrons to replace the lost electrons in light-dependent reaction. As hydrogen ions pass through ATP synthase, ATP is formed. 6CO2 + 6H2O (chlorophyll + sunlight) → C6H12O6 + 6O2 (Glucose) Carbon gets into the leaf through minute pores in leaves called stomata and water goes into the plant through its roots. Oxygen gets out of the cell through stomata.`

    answer: `Answer: C`,
    exp: `Explanation: The digestion functions are taken care of by the gastric glands present in the wall of the stomach. These release Hydrochloric acid, a protein digesting enzyme called pepsin, and mucus. The Hydrochloric acid creates an acidic medium which facilitates the action of the enzyme ‘pepsin’. The mucus protects the inner lining of the stomach from the action of the acid, that causes "acidity" in adults. `

    ],
    answer: `Answer: C`,
    exp: `Explanation: In human beings, air is taken into the body through the nostrils. The air passing through the nostrils is filtered by fine hairs and harmful microbes are trapped. The passage is also lined with mucus which helps in this process. Rings of cartilage are present in throat which ensure that the air passage does not collapse. Once oxygen enters the blood from the lungs, it is taken up by haemoglobin (Hb) in the red blood cells and form oxyhaemoglobin thereby oxygen get circulated in the entire body. `

    ],
    answer: `Answer: B`,
    exp: `Explanation: The force that blood exerts against the wall of a vessel is called blood pressure. This pressure is much greater in arteries than in veins as arteries carry oxygenated blood from heart to other parts of body that emerge at high pressure and remains in the same. The pressure of blood inside the artery during ventricular systole (contraction) is called systolic pressure and pressure in artery during ventricular diastole (relaxation) is called diastolic pressure. The normal systolic pressure is about 120 mm of Hg and diastolic pressure is 80 mm of Hg. Blood pressure is measured with an instrument called sphygmomanometer. `

        'C. 3 only ',
        'D. 1, 2 and 3 ',
    ],
    answer: `Answer: B`,
    exp: `Explanation: The DNA in a cell nucleus is an information source for making proteins. If the information is changed, different proteins will be made. Different proteins will eventually lead to altered body designs. Therefore, a basic event in reproduction is the creation of a DNA copy. Cells use chemical reactions to build copies of their DNA. This creates two copies of the DNA in a reproducing cell, that will need to be separated from each other. No bio-chemical reaction is absolutely reliable. Therefore, it is only to be expected that the process of copying the DNA will have some variations each time. As a result, the DNA copies generated will be similar, but may not be identical to the original. A population of organisms fill well-defined places, or niches, in the ecosystem, by using their ability to reproduce. The consistency of DNA copying during reproduction is important for the maintenance of body design features that allows the organism to use that particular niche. Reproduction is therefore linked to the stability of population of species. `

    answer: `Answer: D`,
    exp: `Explanation: Stamen is the male reproductive part and it produces pollen grains that are yellowish in colour. Carpel is present in the centre of a flower and is the female reproductive part. It is made up of three parts. The swollen bottom part is the ovary, middle elongated part is the style and the terminal part which may be sticky is the stigma. The ovary contains ovules and each ovule has an egg cell. The pollen needs to be transferred from the stamen to the stigma. If this transfer of pollen occurs in the same flower, it is referred to as self-pollination. On the other hand, if the pollen is transferred from one flower to another, it is known as cross pollination. This transfer of pollen from one flower to another is achieved by agents like wind, water or animals.`

    ],
    answer: `Answer: B`,
    exp: `Explanation: The formation of germ-cells or sperms takes place in the testes. These are located outside the abdominal cavity in scrotum because sperm formation requires a lower temperature than the normal body temperature. The role of the testes in the secretion of the hormone, testosterone, is to regulate the formation of sperms, and brings about changes in appearance, seen in boys at the time of puberty such as broadening of chest. In adolescent boys, sometimes, the muscles of the growing Voice Box go out of control and the voice becomes hoarse. `

        'B. 2 only ',
        'C. Both 1 and 2 ',
        'D. Neither 1 nor 2 ',
    ],
    answer: `Answer: C`,
    exp: `Explanation: In asexual reproduction, if one bacterium divides, and then the resultant two bacteria divide again, the four individual bacteria generated would be very similar. There would be only very minor differences between them, generated due to small inaccuracies in DNA copying. However, if sexual reproduction is involved, greater diversity will be generated, and the second generation will have differences that they inherit from the first generation, as well as newly created differences. Variations generated during birth can be hereditary. Due to these differences, survival of the organism can increase. Two copies of the trait are inherited in each sexually reproducing organism. These two may be identical, or may be different, depending on the parentage. For example, both TT and Tt are tall plants, while only tt is a short plant. In other words, a single copy of ‘T’ is enough to make the plant tall, while both copies have to be ‘t’ for the plant to be short. Traits like ‘T’ are called dominant traits, while those that behave like ‘t’ are called recessive traits. The trait that gets expressed in phenotype is called the dominant trait and the other which fails to express is called the recessive trait. `

        'C. 1 and 3 only ',
        'D. 1, 2 and 3 ',
    ],
    answer: `Answer: D`,
    exp: `Explanation: Some species rely entirely on environmental cues. Thus, in some animals, the temperature at which fertilised eggs are kept determines whether the animals developing in the eggs will be male or female. In other animals, such as snails, individuals can change sex, indicating that sex is not genetically determined. . In human beings, the sex of the individual is largely genetically determined. Most human chromosomes have a maternal and a paternal copy, and we have 22 such pairs. But one pair, called the sex chromosomes, is different in men and women. So women are XX, while men are XY. Thus, the sex of the children will be determined by what they inherit from their father. A child who inherits an X chromosome from her father will be a girl, and one who inherits a Y chromosome from him will be a boy. `

        'C. Total internal reflection of light ',
        'D. Diffraction of light ',
    ],
    answer: `Answer: B`,
    exp: `Explanation: The twinkling of a star is due to atmospheric refraction. The starlight, on entering the earth’s atmosphere, undergoes refraction continuously, before it reaches the earth. The atmospheric refraction occurs in a medium of gradually changing refractive index. Since the atmosphere bends starlight towards the normal, the apparent position of the star is slightly different from its actual position. The star appears slightly higher (above) than its actual position when viewed near the horizon. Further, this apparent position of the star is not stationary, but keeps on changing slightly. Since the stars are very distant, they approximate point-sized sources of light. As the path of rays of light coming from the star goes on varying slightly, the apparent position of the star fluctuates and the amount of starlight entering the eye flickers - the star sometimes appears brighter, and at some other time, fainter, which gives the twinkling effect. `

    answer: `Answer: D`,
    exp: `Explanation: The sky appears blue during a clear cloudless day because the molecules in the air scatter blue light from the sun more than they scatter red light. Twinkling of stars is caused by the atmospheric refraction of light. Light from the sun near the horizon passes through thicker layers of air and travel larger distance in the earth’s atmosphere before reaching our eyes. Near the horizon, most of the blue light and other lights with shorter wavelengths are scattered away by the particles. Therefore, the light that reaches our eyes is of longer wavelength. This gives rise to the reddish appearance of the Sun.  `
