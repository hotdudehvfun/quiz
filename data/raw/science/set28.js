            answer: `Answer: B`,
            exp: `Explanation: Viral proteins are proteins generated by a virus. As viruses hijack much of their host's cellular machinery to support their life cycle, they encode very few of their own genes; viral proteins are therefore generally structural components, for the viral envelope and capsid. Non-structural proteins and regulatory or accessory proteins can also be viral proteins. Antiviral proteins are proteins that are induced by human or animal cells to interfere with viral replication. These proteins are isolated to inhibit the virus from replicating in a host's cells and stop it from spreading to other cells. `

            exp: `Explanation: Rabies is a viral disease that is spread through the animal bite such as the dog. It is caused by the infection of rabies virus. The infection caused from this leads to encephalomyelitis i.e the inflammation of the brain as well as the spinal cord. The transmission of the virus happens through the saliva and affects the CNS or Central nervous system. This virus belongs to the family called Rhabdoviridae. It takes the shape of a bullet. Animals such as dogs, rabbits, cats, fox and etc carry this virus and transmit the disease to human beings. Usually, this disease causes about 24,000 - 60,000 deaths in worldwide per year. Control and Prevention of Rabies Prevention is better than cure. Rabies is an infectious disease that can be preventable. Following measures can reduce the infection to nearly high extents. Some of the measures are given below-  Get rabies vaccination injected to prevent the infection.  Vaccinating your pet against the disease.  Maintain distance with the wild animals.  Wash wounds with soap and water and maintain good hygiene.  Keep your pets away from the other stray dogs.  Prevent bats wandering around your campuses and living places. `

            exp: `Explanation: A. Leprosy Definition “Leprosy is a chronic infection that affects the skin, mucous membrane, and nerves, and causes discolouration, lumps, disfigurement and deformities in skin.” What is Leprosy? Leprosy is a disease that causes severe, scarring skin sores and nerve damage in the limbs. Leprosy disease has affected people on every continent. Leprosy is actually not that infectious but it spreads when a healthy person comes in regular and close contact with mouse droplets and leprosy patient. Children get more affected by this disease than adults. Almost, 180000 people all over the world get infected with leprosy. The Leprosy disease mainly affects the peripheral nerves, skin, upper respiratory tract and the eyes. The most prevalent possibility of transmission is through the respiratory route. Leprosy is also transmitted through insects. B. What is AIDS? AIDS or Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome is a syndrome caused by the HIV virus. In this condition, a person’s immune system becomes too weak to fight off any kind of infection or disease. AIDS is usually the last stage of HIV infection; a stage where the body can no longer defend itself and thus spawns various diseases. AIDS, when untreated, leads to death. AIDS is an advanced HIV infection or late-stage HIV. Someone with AIDS may develop a wide range of health conditions like - pneumonia, thrush, fungal infections, TB, toxoplasmosis and cytomegalovirus. There is also an increased risk of developing a medical illness like cancer and brain illnesses. CD4 count refers to the number of Thelper cells in a cubic millilitre of blood. A person may be referred to as “AIDS-affected” when the CD4 count drops below 200 cells per cubic millilitre of blood. C. What is Malaria? Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease caused by various species of the parasitic protozoan microorganisms called Plasmodium. Malaria is a disease that man has battled with for a long time. The first evidence of this protozoan came from mosquitoes preserved in amber nearly 30 million years ago. It is even thought to have brought the Roman Empire to its knees. Malaria was so prevalent during the Roman times that the disease is also called ‘Roman Fever’. Today, the credit for actually discovering the parasite is given to Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran, a French physician. He even won the Nobel Prize in 1907 for his findings. Malaria parasite exists in the form of a motile sporozoite. The vector of malaria i.e. the female Anopheles mosquito transmits the malarial sporozoites into the hosts. When an infected mosquito bites a human, the sporozoites are injected into the blood through the mosquito’s saliva. The sporozoites travel into our body and accumulate in the liver. These parasites initially multiply within the liver, by damaging the liver and rupturing the blood cells in the body. Malaria kills by causing the destruction of the red blood cells in the host. The parasites reproduce asexually in the RBCs, bursting the cells and releasing more parasites to infect more cells. The rupture of red blood cells by the malaria parasite releases a toxin called hemozoin which causes the patient to experience a condition known as the chills. When the female Anopheles mosquito bites an infected human, the parasites enter the mosquito’s body along the human blood it is drinking. It is inside the mosquito’s body that the actual development and maturing of the parasite happens. The parasites produced in the human body reach the intestine of the mosquito where the male and females cells fertilize each other to lead to the formation of a sporozoite. On maturing, the sporozoite breaks out the mosquito’s intestine and migrate to the salivary glands. Once they reach salivary glands, they wait till the mosquito bites another human and the process of infection and disease begins all over again. It is prudent however to observe that the complete development of the malaria parasite takes place in two different hosts; humans and mosquitoes. D. What is Common Cold? Cold or common cold is a disease diagnosed with a headache, runny nose, scratchy throat, fever and non stop sneezing. It is a viral infectious disease of the upper respiratory tract which primarily affects the nose and sometimes sinuses, ears, and bronchial tubes. A common cold is caused by viruses. Some of them include -  Rhinovirus - This one usually intrudes your system during early fall, spring, and summer. They are behind 10%-40% of colds. Even though these are the main common viruses which affect you, they would rarely make you seriously sick.  Coronavirus - The virus affects the human system during winter and early spring. This virus is behind 20% of colds. There are more than 30 types of coronavirus, out of which only 3 or 4 ones are harmful.  RSV and parainfluenza - These tiny organisms are behind severe infections like pneumonia, in young children. `

            exp: `Explanation: What Is Typhoid? Typhoid is an infectious bacterial disease that mainly spreads through contaminated food or water. It can also spread due to the poor hygienic conditions. The major symptoms of this disease are characterized by high fever, loss of appetite and diarrhoea. Salmonella typhi is the bacterium responsible for this disease and humans are the only carriers. The first case of typhoid fever was reported in the United States in the early 1900’s. Overall, about 21 million people are infected with this disease annually, and about 200,000 cases are fatal. Furthermore, scientists have identified 2 types of typhoid causing bacterium, namely: 1. ST1 2. ST2 Causes Of Typhoid: Also called as “Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi”, this microbe is the causative agent for this disease. It is a gram-negative bacteria characterized by a thin cell wall and an outer membrane. The cells are reddish in colour, with some having black stains in the centre. It is rod-shaped and grows in the small intestine of the human body. Human beings are only the main hosts of this bacteria. This type of species can survive in environments which are rich in oxygen and also, they are found in sewage, water bodies and some eventually make their own on to food. The bacteria enter the human body through the contaminated foods and water, where it then enters into the intestinal cells of the human body. Later, it passes through the bloodstream and destroys the lymphatic system and spreads throughout the body. This bacterium is mainly carried by the white blood cells present in the liver and also the bone marrow. There, they multiply and re-enter the blood cells, which in turn, causes a number of symptoms to appear in the later stages. `

                ],
            answer: `Answer: A`,
            exp: `Explanation: A vaccine is a preparation that improves immunity to a particular disease. It is a biological prepared product which contains typical agents resembling a microorganism that causes disease, made from weakened or dead forms of the microbes, one of its surface proteins or its toxins. It helps in the stimulation of the immune system and to identify the invaded microbes as the foreign agent and destroy it so that the immune system can be recognized and destroy any microorganism encountered later. A vaccine is an antigenic substance that develops immunity against a disease which can be delivered through needle injections or by mouth or by aerosol.Vaccination is the injection of a dead or weakened organism that forms immunity against that organism in the body.Immunization is the process by which an animal or a person stays protected from diseases. Vaccines are Safe and Effective: Vaccines are the perfect defense against a preventable and contagious disease that can be deadly. Vaccines are one of the safest medical products available but there are some preventive measures one should adopt. Precise information of the values of vaccines along with their possible side-effects assist people to take decisions on vaccines. How Well Do Vaccines Work? No medicine can be labeled as perfect but most of the vaccines produce immunity for about 90-100% of the cases. Certainly, better sanitation and hygiene can help prevent the spread of disease but the germs that are responsible still stay around. The germs continue to make people sick as long as their existence. Every vaccine has to be licensed by the Food and Drug Administration abbreviated by FDA before being brought into use in the United States. A vaccine needs to go through extensive tests to confirm that it is safe before the approval of FDA. Among these tests are the clinical tests trials that compare groups of people who get a control such as a placebo with the group of people who get a vaccine. A vaccine is approved only when FDA confirms that it is safe for intended use. Vaccines save millions of lives every year. When a particular section of a city or town is immunized against a communicable disease, several members of the same community are shielded against the diseases as the opportunity for an outbreak is minimum. The principle of immunity refers to the control of various contagious diseases that involve rabies, mumps, influenza, measles and pneumococcal disease. `
