        question:`#1. Which of the following are the three primary nutrients needed for plant growth? `,
        options:
        [
'A. Calcium, sulphur and magnesium. ',
'B. Nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. ',
'C. Zinc, boron and copper. ',
            'D. Calcium/zinc/copper. ',
        ],
        answer:`Answer: B`,
        exp:`Explanation: Soil is a major source of nutrients needed by plants for growth. The three main nutrients are nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K). Together they make up the trio known as NPK. Other important nutrients are calcium, magnesium and sulfur. Plants also need small quantities of iron, manganese, zinc, copper, boron and molybdenum, known as trace elements because only traces are needed by the plant. The role these nutrients play in plant growth is complex, and this document provides only a brief outline. Major elements: 1. Nitrogen (N) Nitrogen is a key element in plant growth. It is found in all plant cells, in plant proteins and hormones, and in chlorophyll. Atmospheric nitrogen is a source of soil nitrogen. Some plants such as legumes fix atmospheric nitrogen in their roots; otherwise fertiliser factories use nitrogen from the air to make ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate and urea. When applied to soil, nitrogen is converted to mineral form, nitrate, so that plants can take it up. Soils high in organic matter such as chocolate soils are generally higher in nitrogen than podzolic soils. Nitrate is easily leached out of soil by heavy rain, resulting in soil acidification. You need to apply nitrogen in small amounts often so that plants use all of it, or in organic form such as composted manure, so that leaching is reduced. 2. Phosphorus (P) Phosphorus helps transfer energy from sunlight to plants, stimulates early root and plant growth, and hastens maturity. Very few Australian soils have enough phosphorus for sustained crop and pasture production and the North Coast is no exception. The most common phosphorus source on the North Coast is superphosphate, made from rock phosphate and sulfuric acid. All manures contain phosphorus; manure from grain-fed animals is a particularly rich source. 3. Potassium (K) Potassium increases vigour and disease resistance of plants, helps form and move starches, sugars and oils in plants, and can improve fruit quality. Potassium is low or deficient on many of the sandier soils of the North Coast. Also, heavy potassium removal can occur on soils used for intensive grazing and intensive horticultural crops (such as bananas and custard apples). 4. Calcium (Ca) Calcium is essential for root health, growth of new roots and root hairs, and the development of leaves. It is generally in short supply in the North Coast's acid soils. Lime, gypsum, dolomite and superphosphate (a mixture of calcium phosphate and calcium sulfate) all supply calcium. Lime is the cheapest and most suitable option for the North Coast; dolomite is useful for magnesium and calcium deficiencies, but if used over a long period will unbalance the calcium/magnesium ratio. Superphosphate is useful where calcium and phosphorus are needed. 5. Magnesium (Mg) Magnesium is a key component of chlorophyll, the green colouring material of plants, and is vital for photosynthesis (the conversion of the sun's energy to food for the plant). Deficiencies occur mainly on sandy acid soils in high rainfall areas, especially if used for intensive horticulture or dairying. Heavy applications of potassium in fertilisers can also produce magnesium deficiency, so banana growers need to watch magnesium levels because bananas are big potassium users. Magnesium deficiency can be overcome with dolomite (a mixed magnesium-calcium carbonate), magnesite (magnesium oxide) or epsom salts (magnesium sulfate). 6. Sulfur (S) Sulfur is a constituent of amino acids in plant proteins and is involved in energy-producing processes in plants. It is responsible for many flavour and odour compounds in plants such as the aroma of onions and cabbage. Sulfur deficiency is not a problem in soils high in organic matter, but it leaches easily. On the North Coast seaspray is a major source of atmospheric sulfur. Superphosphate, gypsum, elemental sulfur and sulfate of ammonia are the main fertiliser sources. `

        question:`#2. Which of the following is a food-fodder mixed farming system? `,
        options:
        [
'A. Growing food crops alone ',
'B. Growing fodder crops alone ',
'C. Growing crops which can be used as food and fodder by using more fertilizers. ',
            'D. Growing food crops and fodder crops in the same field. ',
        ],
        answer:`Answer: D`,
        exp:`Explanation: Mixed farming system can be defined as - (i).The use of a single farm for multiple purposes, as the growing of cash crops or the raising of livestock is called as mixed farming. (ii).Farming involving both the growing of crops and the keeping of livestock is called as mixed farming. (iii). A type of commercial agriculture concerned with the production of both crops and animals on one farm. Stock on a mixed farm used to be grazed on fallow land, but many modern mixed farms produce some, or all, of their fodder crops. Mixed farming is a system of farming in which a farmer conducts different types of agricultural practices together, on a single farm in view of increasing his income through different sources, is called as mixed farming. But, what is a farm? & what is Farming? Receiving the radiant energy of sun through crops and cattle is called as farming whereas, the place where these practices are done, is called as a farm. Here is one example: Rearing of cattle and growing fodder for them on a piece of land is called as farming. In other words, Mixed farming is the combining of two independent agricultural enterprises on the same farm. In mixed farming a farmer can take up different types of practices for income generation while doing his main business of agriculture. Some of these practices that can be done together with the main agricultural practices are - poultry faming, dairy farming, bee keeping, sericulture, Pisciculture, shrimp farming, goat and sheep rearing, piggery and agro forestry. Thus a farmer can raise his income manifold through carrying out different farming practices together. The greatest benefit from this type of farming is that if any one business does not pay desired benefit, the same can be recovered from the benefit of the other business. Merits of Mixed Farming System: The mixed farming system is the largest category of livestock system in the world which covers about 2.5 billion hectares of land, of which 1.1 billion hectares are arable rainfed crop land, 0.2 billion hectares are irrigated cropland and 1.2 billion hectares are grassland. This system of farming produces 92% of the world’s milk supply. Some of the important merits of mixed farming are mentioned below. 1. This farming system maintains soil fertility by recycling soil nutrients and allowing the introduction and use of rotations between various crops and forage legumes and trees, or for land to remain fallow and grasses and shrubs to become reestablished; 2. Mixed farming maintains soil biodiversity, minimize soil erosion, help to conserve water and provide suitable habitats for birds; 3. It makes the best use of crop residues. When they are not used as feed, stalks may be incorporated directly into the soil, where, for some time, they act as a nitrogen trap, exacerbating deficiencies. In the tropical semi-arid areas, termite action results in loss of nutrients before the next cropping season. Burning, the other alternative, increases carbon dioxide emissions; and 4. Mixed farming allows intensified farming, with less dependence on natural resources and preserving more biodiversity than would be the case if food demands were to be met by crop and livestock activities undertaken in isolation. There are a number of methods that are adopted in the mixed farming system. Some of these methods are being described below 1. Food -Fodder Farming In this method of mixed farming, the fodder crops are also grown along with other crops. Farmers can grow Sorghum, Pusa Giant Napier; berseem etc. as fodder crops for their cattle alongwith food crops. It is through this system that the availability of high variety of fodder is ensured for milch cattle while growing crops for production of grains, pulses, vegetables, oil and fruits etc. 2. Agroforestry System According to the World Forestry Centre (ICRAF) 1993, - “Agroforestry system is a collective name forthe land use systems and practices in which woody perennial plants are deliberately integrated with crops (and some times animals) on the same land management unit. The integration can be either in a spatial mixture or in a temporal sequence. There are normally both ecological and economic interactions between woody and non-woody components in Agroforestry". Again in the year 2003, the ICRAF further defined the agroforestry system as - a dynamic, ecology based, natural resources management system that, through the integration of trees on farms and in the agricultural landscape, diversifies and sustains production for increased social, economic and environmental benefits for land users at all levels (World Agroforestry Centre, 2003). `

        question:`#4. Which of the following refers to inland fisheries? `,
        options:
        [
'A. Culturing fish in fresh water ',
'B. Deep sea fisheries ',
'C. Trapping and capturing fish from sea coast ',
            'D. Extraction of oil from fishes ',
        ],
        answer:`Answer: A`,
        exp:`Explanation: Inland fisheries are any activity conducted to extract fish and other aquatic organisms from "inland waters". The term "inland waters" is used to refer to lakes, rivers, brooks, streams, ponds, inland canals, dams, and other land-locked (usually freshwater) waters (such as the Caspian Sea, Aral Sea, etc.). Whilst most inland waters are freshwater( i.e. zero salinity), there are many areas that are classified nationally as inland waters which have daily or seasonal fluctuations in salinity (e.g. estuaries, deltas, some coastal lagoons). Some areas are permanently brackishwater (coastal lagoons, the Caspian Sea, Lake Van) or even hypersaline (e.g. The Utah Great Salt Lake). Fisheries in inland waters have long provided an important source of food for mankind. The global population now stands at 7.6 billion and is projected to rise to 9.7 billion people by 2050. Inland capture fisheries have an important role to play in the global challenge to sustainably feed this growing population, as they deliver quality nutrition to some of the world’s most vulnerable populations in a manner that is both accessible and affordable. Inland fisheries are critical for a group of developing countries in the world, providing an important source of nutrition, food security as well as micronutrients. These nutritional and food security benefits are an integral part of the agricultural landscape of these countries, thus inland fisheries are closely linked to food production, water and land management, biodiversity and ecosystems. Inland fisheries are also increasingly impacted and changed as countries develop their water and land resources for agriculture. They are under increasing pressure and threats arising from far reaching changes to the aquatic environment arising from human activities such as damming, navigation, wetland reclamation for agriculture, urbanization, water extraction and transfer, and waste disposal. `

        ],
        answer:`Answer: C`,
        exp:`Explanation: Principles of crop rotation The basic principles of crop rotations are as follows:  Deep rooted crops should be succeeded by shallow rooted crop s such as cotton, castor, pigeon peapotato, lentil, green gram etc.  Dicot crops should be rotated by monocot crops such as mustar d, potato- rice, wheat- sugarcane.  Leguminous crops should be succeeded by nonleguminous crops and vice versa (green gram- wheat).  Exhaustive crops should be succeeded with restorative crops s uch as potato, sorghum, sugarcane, castor- sunhemp, black gra m, cowpea.  Grain crops should be followed by foliage crops such as, wheatdhaincha, black gram.  Long duration crops should be succeeded by short duration cro ps such as sugarcane, napier, Lucerne- cowpea, black gram, grou nd nut.  Crops susceptible to soil borne pathogens and parasitic weeds s hould be followed by tolerant trap crops such as sugarcane- ma rigold, mustard (for nematodes); tobacco- rice, pulses (for oro banche); pearl millet- castor (for striga); lucern, berseem- oats (for cuscuta).  Crops with problematic weeds should be followed by clean crop s/ multi cut crops and other dissimilar crops such as wheat- pu ddle rice for Phalaris minor; berseem- potato for Chicorium int ybus; rice- vegetables for Echinochloa crusgalli.  Heavy irrigation and intensive labour requiring crops should be followed by less water and labour requiring crops such as sugar cane, paddy- mungbean and sesame. Advantages of crop rotation Following are the advantages of an appropriate crop rotation:  Higher yield without incurring extra investment.  Enhance soil fertility and microbial activity.  Avoid accumulation of toxic substances.  The legumes in a cropping system, assimilating nitrogen from th e atmosphere and enriching the soil with their root system.  Better utilization of nutrients and soil moisture.  Insurance against natural devastation.  Maintain soil health by avoiding insect pest, diseases and weed problems.  Provide proper labour, power and capital distribution throughou t the year.  Higher chances to provide diversified commodities.  Slow but steady income, which is beneficial to marginal and sma ll farmers.  Deep rooted crops work the soil below plough layer. `
