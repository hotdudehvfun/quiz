            answer: `Answer: C`,
            exp: `Explanation: Endocrine glands release hormones directly into the bloodstream, and hence are also called ductless glands. Sex hormones are also secreted through endocrine/ductless glands. Estrogen and testosterone are sex hormones which are responsible for secondary sexual characters. Estrogen is the female hormone and testosterone is the male hormone, secreted by ovary in females and testes in males respectively. This sex hormone is responsible for the development of facial hair, enlargement of voice box (larynx, Adam’s apple) etc in males. Due to an enlarged voice box, boys have a deeper voice and girls have a high pitched voice. Secondary sexual characters like development of breasts and mammary glands in females is caused by estrogen. The secretion of these sex hormones is regulated by a separate hormone, secreted by the pituitary. It regulates the maturation of egg/ovum in the ovary and sperms in the testes.`

It can also be defined as the ratio of the force to the area (over which the force is acting). Example: It is easier to hammer a sharp pin than to hammer a blunt pin. This is because the area at the end of the sharp pin is smaller than the area at the end of a blunt pin. This leads to an increase in pressure leading to hammer the sharp pin easily. \n Types of Pressure:  \n 1. Atmospheric Pressure  \n 2. Absolute Pressure  \n 3. Differential Pressure  \n 4.

Each chromosome is made of protein and a single molecule of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Passed from parents to offspring, DNA contains the specific instructions that make each type of living creature unique. The term chromosome comes from the Greek words for color (chroma) and body (soma). Scientists gave this name to chromosomes because they are cell structures, or bodies, that are strongly stained by some colorful dyes used in research. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, for a total of 46 chromosomes. In fact, each species of plants and animals has a set number of chromosomes. A fruit fly, for example, has four pairs of chromosomes, while a rice plant has 12 and a dog, 39.`

Puberty involves a series of physical stages or steps that lead to the achievement of fertility and the development of the so-called secondary sex characteristics, the physical features associated with adult males and females (such as the growth of pubic hair). While puberty involves a series of biological or physical transformations, the process can also have an effect on the psychosocial and emotional development of the adolescent. Puberty usually occurs in girls between the ages of 10 and 14, while in boys it generally occurs later, between the ages of 12 and 16. In some African-American girls, puberty begins earlier, at about age 9, meaning that puberty occurs from ages 9 to 14.`

Force represents as a vector, which means it has both magnitude and direction. In equations and diagrams, a force is usually denoted by the symbol F. An example is an equation from Newton's second law: F = m·a where F = force, m = mass, and a = acceleration. Units of Force The SI unit of force is the newton (N). Other units of force include  dyne  kilogram-force (kilopond)  poundal  pound-force`
