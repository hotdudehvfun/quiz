        Explanation: Weather is the day-to-day state of the atmosphere,
        and its short-term variation in minutes to weeks. People generally
        think of weather as the combination of temperature, humidity,
        precipitation, cloudiness, visibility, and wind.
        Climate is the weather of a place averaged over a period of time,
        often 30 years. Climate information includes the statistical weather
        information that tells us about the normal weather, as well as the
        range of weather extremes for a location.

        Explanation: The polar regions present an extreme climate. These
        regions are covered with snow and it is very cold for most part of
        the year. For six months the sun does not set at the poles while for
        the other six months the sun does not rise. In winters, the

        answer:`Answer: D`,
        exp:`Answer: D
        Explanation: The tropical region has generally a hot climate because
        of its location around the equator. Even in the coldest month the
        temperature is generally higher than about 15°C. During hot
        summers, the temperature may cross 40°C. Days and nights are
        almost equal in length throughout the year. These regions get plenty
        of rainfall. An important feature of this region is the tropical
        rainforests. Tropical rainforests are found in Western Ghats and
        Assam in India, Southeast Asia, Central America and Central Africa.
        The lion-tailed macaque (also called Beard ape) lives in the
        rainforests of Western Ghats. Its most outstanding feature is the
        silver-white mane, which surrounds the head from the cheeks down
        to its chin. It is a good climber feeds mainly on fruits, seeds, young
        leaves, stems, flowers and buds. This beard ape also searches for
        insects under the bark of the trees. Since it is able to get sufficient
        food on the trees, it rarely comes down on the ground.

        answer:`Answer: B`,
        exp:`Answer: B
        Explanation: Wind is the movement of air caused by the uneven
        heating of the Earth by the sun. It does not have much substance—
        you cannot see it or hold it—but you can feel its force. It can dry
        your clothes in summer and chill you to the bone in winter. It is
        strong enough to carry sailing ships across the ocean and rip huge
        trees from the ground. It is the great equalizer of the atmosphere,
        transporting heat, moisture, pollutants, and dust great distances
        around the globe. Landforms, processes, and impacts of wind are
        called Aeolian landforms, processes, and impacts.
        Differences in atmospheric pressure generate winds. At the
        Equator, the sun warms the water and land more than it does the
        rest of the globe. Warm equatorial air rises higher into the
        atmosphere and migrates toward the poles. This is a low-pressure
        system. At the same time, cooler, denser air moves over Earth’s
        surface toward the Equator to replace the heated air. This is a highpressure system. Winds generally blow from high-pressure areas to
        low-pressure areas.
        The boundary between these two areas is called a front. The
        complex relationships between fronts cause different types of wind
        and weather patterns.
        Prevailing winds are winds that blow from a single direction over a
        specific area of the Earth. Areas where prevailing winds meet are
        called convergence zones. Generally, prevailing winds blow east-west
        rather than north-south. This happens because
        Earth’s rotation generates what is known as the Coriolis effect.
        The Coriolis effect makes wind systems twist counter-clockwise in
        the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern
        Hemisphere.
        The Coriolis effect causes some winds to travel along the edges of
        the high-pressure and low-pressure systems. These are
        called geostrophic winds. In 1857, Dutch meteorologist Christoph
        Buys Ballot formulated a law about geostrophic winds: When you
        stand with your back to the wind in the Northern Hemisphere, low
        pressure is always to your left. (In the Southern Hemisphere, lowpressure systems will be on your right.)

        answer:`Answer: A`,
        exp:`Answer: A
        Explanation: The Sun's rays are straight at the equator, so the
        areas around the equator receive maximum heat.The warm air rises,
        and the cooler air from the regions in the 0-30 degrees latitude belt
        on either side of the equator moves in. These winds blow from the
        north and the south towards the equator. At the poles, the air is
        colder than that at latitudes about 60 degrees. The warm air at
        these latitudes rises up and the cold wind from the polar regions
        rushes in, to take its place. In this way, wind circulation is set up
        from the poles to the warmer latitudes.

        answer:`Answer: D`,
        exp:`Answer: D
        Explanation: In summer, near the equator the land warms up faster
        and most of the time the temperature of the land is higher than
        that of water in the oceans. The air over the land gets heated and
        rises. This causes the winds to flow from the oceans towards the
        land. These are monsoon winds.
        In winter, the direction of the wind flow gets reversed; it flows
        from the land to the ocean.The winds from the oceans carry water

        ],
        answer:`Answer: C`,
        exp:`Answer: C
        Explanation: Thunderstorms develop in hot, humid tropical areas
        like India very frequently. The rising temperatures produce strong
        upward rising winds. These winds carry water droplets upwards,
        where they freeze, and fall down again. The swift movement of the
        falling water droplets along with the rising air create lightning and
        sound. It is this event that we call a thunderstorm.
        The centre of a cyclone is a calm area. It is called the eye of the
        storm. A large cyclone is a violently rotating mass of air in the
        atmosphere, 10 to 15 km high. The diameter of the eye varies from
        10 to 30 km. It is a region free of clouds and has light winds. Around
        this calm and clear eye, there is a cloud region of about 150 km in
        size. In this region there are high-speed winds (150-250 km/h) and
        thick clouds with heavy rain. Away from this region the wind speed
        gradually decreases. The formation of a cyclone is a very complex
        process.

        answer:`Answer: B`,
        exp:`Answer: B
        Explanation: India's coast is extremely vulnerable to cyclones. With
        a coastline of 7517 km, the country is exposed to nearly 10 per cent
        of the world's tropical cyclones. Although cyclones affect the entire
        coast of India, the eastern coast is significantly more prone to
        cyclones as compared to the western coast.
        East coast of India faces the Bay of Bengal while the west coast of
        India is situated on the shores of Arabian Sea.Bay of Bengal is very
        active in the months of October to December during the end phase
        of South west monsoon and whole of North east monsoon period.
        During these periods, the easterlies pick up moisture from BoB and
        the remnants of typhoons from Malay peninsula enter the waters of
        BoB and form low pressure troughs. They further intensify in
        strength due to favourable warm temperatures of sea and increased
        sea travel.
        The cyclones then travel in eastern direction due to prevailing
        easterlies and cross the shores of eastern states of India. The
        entire east coast from Tamil Nadu to West Bengal is prone to
        cyclones. Cities like Chennai, Nagapattinam, Rameshwaram,
        Srikakulam, Gopalpur, Cox Bazaar(Bangladesh) are extremely prone
        to cyclones.
        Cyclones do originate in Arabian sea but they mostly tend to move
        away from west coast of India towards Oman, Yemen or Somalia.
        This is due to strong winds from BoB and peninsular India pushing
        the cyclones/depressions further away.

        answer:`Answer: D`,
        exp:`Answer: D
        Explanation: A tropical cyclone is a storm system, characterised by
        a low-pressure centre surrounded by a spiral arrangement of
        thunderstorms that produce strong winds and heavy rain.
        A characteristic feature of tropical cyclones is the eye, a central
        region of clear skies, warm temperatures, and low atmospheric
        pressure. Typically, atmospheric pressure at the surface of Earth is
        about 1,000 millibars. At the centre of a tropical cyclone, however,
        it is typically around 960 millibars, and in a very intense “super
        typhoon” of the western Pacific it may be as low as 880 millibars. In
        addition to low pressure at the centre, there is also a rapid variation
        of pressure across the storm, with most of the variation occurring
        near the centre. This rapid variation results in a large pressure
        gradient force, which is responsible for the strong winds present in
        the eyewall
        Horizontal winds within the eye, on the other hand, are light. In
        addition, there is a weak sinking motion, or subsidence, as air is
        pulled into the eyewall at the surface. As the air subsides, it
        compresses slightly and warms, so that temperatures at the centre
        of a tropical cyclone are some 5.5 °C (10 °F) higher than in other
        regions of the storm. Because warmer air can hold more moisture
        before condensation occurs, the eye of the cyclone is generally free
        of clouds. Reports of the air inside the eye being “oppressive” or
        “sultry” are most likely a psychological response to the rapid change
        from high winds and rain in the eyewall to calm conditions in the eye.
