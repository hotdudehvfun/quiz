                ],
            answer: `Answer: C`,
            exp: `Explanation: Various Causes of Water Pollution 1. Industrial waste: Industries produce a huge amount of waste which contains toxic chemicals and pollutants which can cause air pollution and damage to us and our environment. They contain pollutants such as lead, mercury, sulfur, asbestos, nitrates, and many other harmful chemicals. Many industries do not have a proper waste management system and drain the waste in the fresh water which goes into rivers, canals and later into the sea. The toxic chemicals have the capability to change the color of water, increase the number of minerals, also known as eutrophication, change the temperature of water and pose a serious hazard to water organisms. 2. Sewage and wastewater: The sewage and wastewater that is produced by each household is chemically treated and released into the sea with fresh water. The sewage water carries harmful bacteria and chemicals that can cause serious health problems. Pathogens are known as a common water pollutant; The sewers of cities house several pathogens and thereby diseases. Microorganisms in water are known to be causes of some very deadly diseases and become the breeding grounds for other creatures that act as carriers. These carriers inflict these diseases via various forms of contact onto an individual. A very common example of this process would be Malaria. 3. Mining activities: Mining is the process of crushing the rock and extracting coal and other minerals from underground. These elements when extracted in the raw form contains harmful chemicals and can increase the number of toxic elements when mixed up with water which may result in health problems. Mining activities emit a large amount of metal waste and sulphides from the rocks which is harmful to the water. 4. Marine dumping: The garbage produced by each household in the form of paper, aluminum, rubber, glass, plastic, food is collected and deposited into the sea in some countries. These items take from 2 weeks to 200 years to decompose. When such items enter the sea, they not only cause water pollution but also harm animals in the sea. 5. Accidental oil leakage: Oil spill poses a huge concern as a large amount of oil enters into the sea and does not dissolve with water; thereby opens problem for local marine wildlife such as fish, birds and sea otters. For e.g.: a ship carrying a large quantity of oil may spill oil if met with an accident and can cause varying damage to species in the ocean depending on the quantity of oil spill, size of the ocean, the toxicity of pollutant. 6. The burning of fossil fuels: Fossil fuels like coal and oil when burnt produce a substantial amount of ash in the atmosphere. The particles which contain toxic chemicals when mixed with water vapor result in acid rain. Also, carbon dioxide is released from the burning of fossil fuels which result in global warming. 7. Chemical fertilizers and pesticides: Chemical fertilizers and pesticides are used by farmers to protect crops from insects and bacterias. They are useful for the plant’s growth. However, when these chemicals are mixed up with water produce harmful for plants and animals. Also, when it rains, the chemicals mix up with rainwater and flow down into rivers and canals which pose serious damages for aquatic animals. 8. Leakage from sewer lines: A small leakage from the sewer lines can contaminate the underground water and make it unfit for the people to drink. Also, when not repaired on time, the leaking water can come on to the surface and become a breeding ground for insects and mosquitoes. 9. Global warming: An increase in earth’s temperature due to the greenhouse effect results in global warming. It increases the water temperature and results in the death of aquatic animals and marine species which later results in water pollution. 10. Radioactive waste: Nuclear energy is produced using nuclear fission or fusion. The element that is used in the production of nuclear energy is Uranium which is a highly toxic chemical. The nuclear waste that is produced by radioactive material needs to be disposed of to prevent any nuclear accident. Nuclear waste can have serious environmental hazards if not disposed of properly. Few major accidents have already taken place in Russia and Japan. 11. Urban development: As the population has grown, so has the demand for housing, food, and cloth. As more cities and towns are developed, they have resulted in increasing use of fertilizers to produce more food, soil erosion due to deforestation, increase in construction activities, inadequate sewer collection, and treatment, landfills as more garbage is produced, increase in chemicals from industries to produce more materials. 12. Leakage from the landfills: Landfills are nothing but a huge pile of garbage that produces the awful smell and can be seen across the city. When it rains, the landfills may leak and the leaking landfills can pollute the underground water with a large variety of contaminants. 13. Animal waste: The waste produced by animals is washed away into the rivers when it rains. It gets mixed up with other harmful chemicals and causes various water-borne diseases like cholera, diarrhea, jaundice, dysentery and typhoid. 14. Underground storage leakage: Transportation of coal and other petroleum products through underground pipes is well known. Accidentals leakage may happen anytime and may cause damage to the environment and result in soil erosion. `

                ],
            answer: `Answer: D`,
            exp: `Explanation: To understand ozone layer, it would be helpful to know the different layers of the atmosphere. The earth’s atmosphere is composed of many layers, each playing a significant role. The first layer stretching approximately 10 kilometers upwards from the earth’s surface is known as the troposphere. A lot of human activities such as gas balloons, mountain climbing, and small aircraft flights take place within this region. The stratosphere is the next layer above the troposphere stretching approximately 15 to 60 kilometers. The ozone layer sits in the lower region of the stratosphere from about 20-30 kilometers above the surface of the earth. The thickness of the ozone layer is about 3 to 5 mm, but it pretty much fluctuates depending on the season and geography. Ozone layer is a deep layer in earth’s atmosphere that contain ozone which is a naturally occurring molecule containing three oxygen atoms. These ozone molecules form a gaseous layer in the Earth’s upper atmosphere called stratosphere. This lower region of stratosphere containing relatively higher concentration of ozone is called Ozonosphere. The Ozonosphere is found 15-35 km (9 to 22 miles) above the surface of the earth. The concentration of ozone in the ozone layer is usually under 10 parts per million while the average concentration of ozone in the atmosphere is about 0.3 parts per million. The thickness of the ozone layer differs as per season and geography. The highest concentrations of ozone occur at altitudes from 26 to 28 km (16 to 17 miles) in the tropics and from 12 to 20 km (7 to 12 miles) towards the poles. Why Ozone Layer is Necessary? An essential property of ozone molecule is its ability to block solar radiations of wavelengths less than 290 nanometers from reaching Earth’s surface. In this process, it also absorbs ultraviolet radiations that are dangerous for most living beings. UV radiation could injure or kill life on Earth. Though the absorption of UV radiations warms the stratosphere but it is important for life to flourish on planet Earth. Research scientists have anticipated disruption of susceptible terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems due to depletion of ozone layer. Ultraviolet radiation could destroy the organic matter. Plants and plankton cannot thrive, both acts as food for land and sea animals, respectively. For humans, excessive exposure to ultraviolet radiation leads to higher risks of cancer (especially skin cancer) and cataracts. It is calculated that every 1 percent decrease in ozone layer results in a 2-5 percent increase in the occurrence of skin cancer. Other ill-effects of the reduction of protective ozone layer include - increase in the incidence of cataracts, sunburns and suppression of the immune system. Causes of Ozone Layer Depletion: Credible scientific studies have substantiated that the cause of ozone layer depletion is human activity, specifically, human-made chemicals that contain chlorine or bromine. These chemicals are widely known as ODS, an acronym for Ozone-Depleting Substances. The scientists have observed reduction in stratospheric ozone since early 1970’s. It is found to be more prominent in Polar Regions. Ozone-Depleting Substances have been proven to be eco-friendly, very stable and non-toxic in the atmosphere below. This is why they have gained popularity over the years. However, their stability comes at a price; they are able to float and remain static high up in the stratosphere. When up there, ODS are comfortably broken down by the strong UV light and the resultant chemical is chlorine and bromine. Chlorine and bromine are known to deplete the ozone layer at supersonic speeds. They do this by simply stripping off an atom from the ozone molecule. One chlorine molecule has the capability to break down thousands of ozone molecules. Ozone-depleting substances have stayed and will continue to stay in the atmosphere for many years. This, essentially, implies that a lot of the ozone-depleting substances human have allowed to go into the atmosphere for the previous 90 years are still on their journey to the atmosphere, which is why they will contribute to ozone depletion. The chief ozone-depleting substances include chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), carbon tetrachloride, hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and methyl chloroform. Halons, sometimes known as brominated fluorocarbons, also contribute mightily to ozone depletion. However, their application is greatly restricted since they are utilized in specific fire extinguishers. The downside to halons is they are so potent that they are able to deplete the ozone layer 10 times more than ozone-depleting substances. Scientists in this age are working around the clock to develop Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) to take the place of hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) for use in vehicle air conditioning. Hydrochlorofluorocarbons are powerful greenhouse gases, but they are not able to deplete ozone. Chlorofluorocarbons, on the other hand, significantly contribute to climate change, which means Hydrofluorocarbons continue to be the better alternative until safer alternatives are available. There are two regions in which the ozone layer has depleted.  In the mid-latitude, for example, over Australia, ozone layer is thinned. This has led to an increase in the UV radiation reaching the earth. It is estimated that about 5-9% thickness of the ozone layer has decreased, increasing the risk of humans to over-exposure to UV radiation owing to outdoor lifestyle.  In atmospheric regions over Antarctica, ozone layer is significantly thinned, especially in spring season. This has led to the formation of what is called ‘ozone hole’. Ozone holes refer to the regions of severely reduced ozone layers. Usually ozone holes form over the Poles during the onset of spring seasons. One of the largest such hole appears annually over Antarctica between September and November. `

            answer: `Answer: A`,
            exp: `Explanation: Nitrogen fixation is the essential biological process and the initial stage of the nitrogen cycle. In this process, nitrogen in the atmosphere is converted into ammonia (another form of nitrogen) by certain bacterial species like Rhizobium, Azotobacter, etc. and by other natural phenomena. Plants are the main of the sources of food. The nutrients obtained from plants are synthesized by plants using various elements which they obtain from the atmosphere as well as from the soil. This group of elements includes nitrogen as well. Plants obtain nitrogen from the soil through the process of protein synthesis. Unlike carbon dioxide and oxygen, atmospheric nitrogen cannot be obtained through stomata of leaves. Because the concentration of nitrogen gas present in the atmosphere can not be directly used by plants and also the concentration of the usable form of nitrogen in the atmosphere is very less. There are certain bacteria and some natural phenomenon which help in Nitrogen fixation. `
