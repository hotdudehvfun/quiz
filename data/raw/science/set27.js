            Explanation: Sound waves travel through a medium by alternately contracting and expanding the parts of the medium in which it travels. The speed of sound is the distance travelled per unit time by any sound. In the next section few sections, let us learn to determine the speed of sound in various medium. What is Speed of Sound? The speed of sound is defined as the dynamic propagation of sound waves. This depends on the characteristics of the medium through which the propagation takes place. Speed of sound is used for describing the speed of sound waves in an elastic medium. Speed of Sound Formula The formula for speed of sound is given with respect to gases. It is the square root of product of coefficient of adiabatic expansion and pressure of the gas divided by the density of the medium. The mathematical representation is given as: What is the Speed of Sound in Air? The speed of sound is an essential parameter used in a variety of field in Physics. The speed of sound refers to the distance travelled per unit time by a sound wave propagating through a medium. The speed of sound in air at 20oC is 343.2 m/s which translates to 1,236 km/h. The speed of sound in gases is proportional to the square root of the absolute temperature (measured in Kelvin) but it is independent of the frequency of the sound wave or the pressure and the density of the medium. But none of the gases we find in real life are ideal gases and this causes the properties to slightly change. Speed of Sound in Solid, Liquid and Gases Sound can travel through wood too! In fact, sound likes travelling through solid more. In the olden days, doctors used stethoscopes consisting of thin wooden rods with broadened ends and they worked exactly like our modern ones and performed just as well. How can sound travel through solids? Speed of Sound in Solid Sound is nothing more than a disturbance which is propagated by the collisions between the particles; one molecule hitting the next and so forth. Solids are significantly denser than liquids or gases. This means that the molecules are closer to each other in solids than in liquids and in liquids than in gases. This closeness due to density means that they can collide very quickly. Effectively it takes less time for a molecule of a solid to bump into its neighbouring molecule. Due to this advantage, the speed of sound in a solid is larger than in a gas. Speed of Sound in Liquid Similarly, the density of a liquid is greater than the density of a gas. Therefore the distances between molecules are more in liquids than in solids but are less than in gases. Hence the speed of sound in liquids lies in between the speed of sound in solids and gases. Speed of Sound in Gas We should remember that the speed of sound is independent of the density of the medium when it enters a liquid or solid. Since gases expand to fill the given space, density is quite uniform irrespective of the type of gas. This clearly isn't the case with solids and liquids.

            answer: `Answer: D`,
            exp: `Explanation: A sound is a form of energy, just like electricity, heat or light. Let’s examine some sources of sounds like a bell. When you strike a bell, it makes a loud ringing noise. Now, instead of just listening to the bell, put your finger on the bell after you have struck it. Can you feel it vibrating? This is the key to the sound. It is even more evident in guitars and drums. You can see the wires vibrating every time you pluck it. When the bell or the guitar stops vibrating, the sound also stops. The to and fro motion of the body is termed as Vibration. You can see examples of vibrations everywhere. Vibrating objects produce sound. Some vibrations are visible, some aren’t. If you pull and then release a stretched rubber band, the band moves to and fro about the central axis and while doing so it also produces a sound. The sound moves through a medium by alternately contracting and expanding parts of the medium it is travelling through. In physics, Sound is a vibration that propagates as an acoustic wave, through a transmission medium such as a gas, liquid or solid. Sound is pictorially represented by a continuous succession of peaks and valleys. The distance between two consecutive peaks or trough is termed as the wavelength of the wave or the period. The number of cycles per unit time is termed as the frequency of the sound. Frequency is measured in cycles per second or Hertz. The faster an object vibrates, i.e. the higher the frequency, then the higher the pitch of the sound. The difference between a man’s voice and women must be clearly evident to you. The voice of a man has a lower frequency which contributes to the deepness of the bass in the voice. Women, in contrast, have a voice with higher frequency resulting in a higher shrillness or pitch. What Is Longitudinal Wave? Longitudinal waves are the waves where the displacement of the medium is in the same direction, or in opposite direction, and direction of the travel of the wave. The distance between the centers of two consecutive regions of compression or the rarefaction is defined by wavelength, λ. When the compression and rarefaction regions are of two waves coincide with each other, it is known as constructive interference and if the regions of compression and rarefaction do not coincide, it is known as destructive interference. Sound Waves: A sound wave is an example of a longitudinal wave and is produced by the vibrating motion of the particles that travel through a conductive medium. The example of sound waves in a longitudinal direction is tuning fork. In Sound waves, the amplitude of the wave is the difference between the maximum pressure caused by the wave and the pressure of the undisturbed air. The propagation speed of sound depends upon the type, composition of the medium and temperature through which it propagates. `

            exp: `Explanation: What is Ultrasound? Sound waves with frequencies higher than the upper audible limit of human hearing are called ultrasound. The limit varies from person to person but is approximately 20,000 Hertz. The physical properties of ultrasound are similar to the normal audible sound. This type of scientific concept is used in many different fields such as navigation, medicine, imaging, cleaning, mixing, communication, testing etc. Even in nature, bats and porpoises use this particular technique for the location of prey and obstacles. In the following section, we shall learn about its applications. Applications: 1. Cleaning: In objects with parts that are difficult to reach, for example, spiral tubes and electronic components, the process of ultrasonic cleaning is used. Here, the object is dipped in a solution of suitable cleaning material and ultrasonic waves are passed into it. As a result of this, high-frequency waves are generated that cause the dirt and grease to detach from the surface. 2. Detection of cracks: Ultrasound is used to detect cracks in the metallic components that are used in the construction of high rise structures such as buildings and bridges. They generate and display an ultrasonic waveform that is interpreted by a trained operator, often with the aid of analysis software, to locate and categorize flaws in test pieces. High-frequency sound waves reflect from flaws in predictable ways, producing distinctive echo patterns that can be displayed and recorded by portable instruments. A trained operator identifies specific echo patterns corresponding to the echo response from good parts and from representative flaws. The echo pattern from a test piece may then be compared to the patterns from these calibration standards to determine its condition. 3. Echocardiography: In the process of electrocardiography, the ultrasonic waves are used to form an image of the heart using reflection and detection of these waves from various parts. 4. Ultrasonography: ,Medical ultrasound is a diagnostic imaging technique based on it. It is used for the imaging of internal body structures such as muscles, joints and internal organs. Ultrasonic images are known as sonograms. In this process, pulses of ultrasound are sent to the tissue using a probe. The sound echoes off the tissue, where different tissues reflect sound varying in degrees. These echoes are recorded and displayed an image. 5. Lithotripsy: Ultrasonic waves are used to break stones in the kidney. High energy sound waves are passed through the body without injuring it and break the stone into small pieces. These small pieces move through the urinary tract and out of the body more easily than a large stone. 6. SONAR: SONAR, Sound Navigation, and Ranging is a technique in which sound waves are used to navigate, detect and communicate under the surface of the water. 7. Echolocation: Echolocation is the process where sound waves and echoes are used to determine objects in space. Echolocation is used by bats to navigate and find their food in the dark. Bats send out sound waves from their mouth and nose, which then hit the objects in their vicinity producing echoes, which are then received by the bats. The nature of the echo helps them determine the size, the shape and the distance of the object. `
