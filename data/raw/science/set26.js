            answer: `Answer: D`,
            exp: `Explanation: The term potential energy was introduced by the 19thcentury Scottish engineer and physicist William Rankine. There are several types of potential energy, each associated with a distinct type of force. It is the energy by virtue of an object’s position relative to other objects. We can define potential energy as: The energy held by an object because of its position relative to other objects, stresses within itself, its electric charge, or other factors. Similarly, in the case of a spring, when it is displaced from its equilibrium position, it gains some amount of energy which we observe in the form of stress we feel in our hand upon stretching it. We can define potential energy as a form of energy that results from the alteration of its position or state. Potential Energy Formula: The formula for potential energy depends on the force acting on the two objects. For the gravitational force the formula is: W = m×g×h = mgh,  Where, m is the mass in kilograms g is the acceleration due to gravity h is the height in meters Unit: Gravitational potential energy has the same units as kinetic energy: kg m2 / s2 Note: All energy has the same units - kg m2 / s2, and is measured using the unit Joule (J). `

            answer: `Answer: C`,
            exp: `Explanation: A force must be applied on a body to accelerate an object. Work must be done in order to apply a force. The body will move with an unvarying speed after the work has been done due to the energy provided by it. The speed and the mass of the body are factors on which the energy transfer that makes up the kinetic energy depends.,  The kinetic energy of an object is the energy that it possesses due to its motion. Kinetic energy definition is given as: The energy of an object because of its motion or the energy gained by an object from its state of rest to motion. Formula of Kinetic Energy: Following is the formula of kinetic energy: KE=12mv2 Where, KE is the kinetic energy of the object m is the mass of an object v is the velocity of an object Kinetic energy is an example of scalar quantity which means that the quantity has only magnitude and no direction. Unit of Kinetic Energy: The SI unit of kinetic energy is Joule which is equal to 1 kg.m2.s-2. The CGS unit of kinetic energy is erg. What are the Examples of Kinetic Energy? 1. A semi-truck travelling down the road has more kinetic energy than a car travelling at the same speed because the truck’s mass is much more than the car’s.,  2. A river flowing at a certain speed comprises kinetic energy as water has certain velocity and mass. 3. The kinetic energy of an asteroid falling towards earth is very large. 4. The kinetic energy of the aeroplane is more during the flight due to large mass and speedy velocity.`

            answer: `Answer: C`,
            exp: `Explanation: Power is always dependent on work done, so if a person does work at different rates his power also differs at different times. This is where the concept of average-power comes into the picture. What is Power? We can define power as the rate of doing work, it is the work done in unit time. The SI unit of power is Watt (W) which is joules per second (J/s). Sometimes the power of motor vehicles and other,  machines are given in terms of Horsepower (hp), which is approximately equal to 745.7 watts. What is Average Power? We can define average power as the total energy consumed divided by the total time taken. In simple language, we can say that average power is the average amount of work done or energy converted per unit of time. Power Formula: Power is defined as the rate at which work is done upon an object. Power is a time-based quantity. which is related to how fast a job is done. The formula for power is mentioned below. Power = Work / time P = W / t Unit of Power: The unit for standard metric work is the Joule and the standard metric unit for time is the second, so the standard metric unit for power is a Joule / second, defined as a Watt and abbreviated W.`

            answer: `Answer: A`,
            exp: `Explanation: If you rub your hands together for several seconds, you'll notice that your hands feel warm. That warmth is caused by a force called friction. When objects like your hands come in contact and move against each other, they produce friction. Friction is defined as: The resistance offered by the surfaces that are in contact with each other when they move over each other. Friction works in the opposite direction in which the body is moving making the body slow down. Friction is useful in most of the cases. Friction is also dependent on the external factors. Factors Affecting Friction: Following are the two factors on which friction depends 1. On the nature of the two surfaces that are in contact: Friction is dependent on the smoothness or roughness of the two surfaces that are in contact with each other. When the surface is smooth, the friction between the two reduces as there is no much interlocking of irregularities taking place. While the surface is rough, friction increases. 2. On the force that is acting on these surfaces: When force is applied along with the irregularities, friction increases.,  What Causes Friction? When we see any object, we can see the smooth surface but when the same object is viewed under a microscope, it can seen that even the smooth appearing object has rough edges. Tiny hills and grooves can be seen through the microscope and they are known as irregularities of the surface. So, when one object is moved over the other, these irregularities on the surface get entangled giving rise to friction. More the roughness, more will the irregularities and greater will be the force applied. `

We know that energy exists in different forms in nature. You have learned about various forms of energy - heat, electrical, chemical, nuclear, etc. In this article, we will learn about the laws and principles that govern energy. This law is known as the law of conservation of energy. What is the Law of Conservation of Energy? The law of conservation of energy states that energy can neither be created nor be destroyed. Although, it may be transformed from one form to another. If you take all forms of energy into account, the total energy of an isolated system always remains constant. All the forms of energy follow the law of conservation of energy. In brief, the law of conservation of energy states that: In a closed system, i.e., a system that is isolated from its surroundings, the total energy of the system is conserved. Law of Conservation of Energy Examples: In physics, most of the inventions rely on the fact that energy is conserved when it is transferred from one form to another. A,  number of electrical and mechanical devices operate solely on the law of conservation of energy. We will discuss a few examples here.  In a torch, the chemical energy of the batteries is converted into electrical energy, which is converted into light and heat energy.  In hydroelectric power plants, waterfalls on the turbines from a height. This, in turn, rotates the turbines and generates electricity. Hence, the potential energy of water is converted into the kinetic energy of the turbine, which is further converted into electrical energy.  In a loudspeaker, electrical energy is converted into sound energy.  In a microphone, sound energy is converted into electrical energy.  In a generator, mechanical energy is converted into electrical energy.  When fuels are burnt, chemical energy is converted into heat and light energy.  Chemical energy from food is converted to thermal energy when it is broken down in the body and is used to keep it warm. `

            exp: `Explanation: What is Energy? Energy is defined as the ability to do work where work is the movement of a body to be some force. We need energy all the time and energy comes in various forms. What is Chemical Energy? Chemical energy is defined as : the energy which is stored in the bonds of chemical compounds (molecules and atoms). It is released in the chemical reaction and mostly produces heat as a by-product, known as an exothermic reaction. The examples of stored chemical energy are biomass, batteries, natural gas, petroleum, and coal. Mostly, when the chemical energy is released from a substance, it is transformed into a new substance completely. For instance, when an explosion goes off, the chemical energy in it is transferred to the surroundings as thermal energy, kinetic energy, and sound energy. Chemical Energy in Everyday Life:  We know that plants need solar energy to produce sugar from carbon dioxide to water. Sugar, water and carbon dioxide stay together by chemical bonds that hold the chemicals together.,   For instance, all sugars consist of oxygen, carbon and hydrogen atoms held together by chemical bonds. These atoms do not connect together automatically; rather some energy is required to make them stay together.  Plants use solar energy to put the hydrogen, the carbon and the oxygen atoms as a whole in the form of sugar. This is a suitable example of energy transformation where energy is transformed from one form to another. Here, solar energy is transformed into chemical energy and prevents from falling apart. `

Light gets transferred in the form of,  electromagnetic radiation. Other examples are solar radiation, nuclear radiation etc Electromagnetic radiation is continuously emitted from all substances because of the molecular as well as atomic vibration accompanying the internal energy. The equilibrium state gives the internal energy proportional to the material temperature as well as that’s the reason we’re not aware of these radiant energy which constantly surrounds us as our body can detect only some portions of the spectrum. Our eyes can detect light as they’re very sensitive to changes in light occurring around us as well as our sensitive skin can detect heat radiation however unless these heat radiations is quite large we can’t sense it . The Radiant heat energy is a notion which is rather more nicely explained by Stefan’s law. This law elucidates how the heat is radiated! It states that, The amount of heat which is radiated (E) by a flawless black body for a second in a provided unit area is directly related to the fourth power of its absolute temperature (T).`
