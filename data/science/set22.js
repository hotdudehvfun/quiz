Everything in the universe (except energy) is made of matter, and, so, everything in the universe is made of atoms. An atom itself is made up of three tiny kinds of particles called subatomic particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons. The protons and the neutrons make up the center of the atom called the nucleus and the electrons fly around above the nucleus in a small cloud. The electrons carry a negative charge and the protons carry a positive charge. In a normal (neutral) atom the number of protons and the number of electrons are equal. Often, but not always, the number of neutrons is the same, too.`

Primarily, the atomic structure of matter is made up of protons, electrons, and neutrons. The protons and neutrons make up the nucleus of the atom, which is surrounded by the electrons belonging to the atom. The atomic number of an element describes the total number of protons in its nucleus. Neutral atoms have equal numbers of protons and electrons. However, atoms may gain or lose electrons in order to increase their stability, and the resulting charged entity is called an ion. Atoms of different elements have different atomic structures because they contain different numbers of protons and electrons. This is the reason for the unique characteristics of different elements.`

His atomic model is based on the Alpha ray scattering experiment. Alpha Ray Scattering Experiment: A. Construction: 1. A very thin gold foil of 1000 atoms thick is taken. 2. Alpha rays (doubly charged Helium He2+) were made to bombard the gold foil. 3. ZnS screen is placed behind the gold foil. B. Observations: 1. Most of the rays just went through the gold foil making scintillations (bright spots) in the ZnS screen. 2. A few rays got reflected after hitting the gold foil. 3. One in 1000 rays got reflected by an angle of 180° (retraced path) after hitting the gold foil. C. Conclusions: 1. Since most rays passed through, Rutherford concluded that most of the space inside the atom is empty. 2. Few rays got reflected because of the repulsion of its positive with some other positive charge inside the atom. 3. 1/1000th of rays got strongly deflected because of a very strong positive charge in the center of the atom he called this strong positive charge as “nucleus”. 4. He said most of the charge and mass of the atom resides in the Nucleus Rutherford’s Structure of Atom: Based on the above observations and conclusions, Rutherford proposed his own atomic structure which is as follows. 1. The nucleus is at the center of an atom, where most of the charge and mass are concentrated. 2. Atomic structure is spherical. 3. Electrons revolve around the nucleus in a circular orbit, similar to the way planets orbit the sun. Limitations of Rutherford Atomic Model: 1. If electrons have to revolve around the nucleus, they will spend energy and that too against the strong force of attraction from the nucleus, a lot of energy will be spent by the electrons and eventually, they will lose all their energy and will fall into the nucleus so the stability of atom is not explained. 2. If electrons continuously revolve around the ‘nucleus, the type of spectrum expected is a continuous spectrum. But in reality, what we see is a line spectrum.`

            answer: `Answer: B`,
            exp: `Explanation: Elements with the same atomic number but a different mass number are defined as “Isotopes”. The number of protons and neutrons combined together is called atomic mass or mass number of an element, whereas the total number of protons gives the atomic number of an element. In a certain element, the number of protons will always remain constant. However, the number of neutrons can change. The number of neutrons varies but the number of protons always remains same in an isotope of a single element. Thus, the definition “Elements with the same atomic number but a different mass number are termed as Isotopes.” For Example: Hydrogen has three most stable isotopic formsprotium, deuterium, as well as tritium. All the three isotopic forms of hydrogen have the same number of protons but vary in the number of neutrons. The number of neutrons in protium is zero, the number of neutrons in deuterium is one and the number of neutrons in tritium is two. Chemical properties: Generally, the chemical properties of isotopes of any element are almost identical. The exception to this case is the isotopes of hydrogen because the numbers of neutrons have a major effect on the size of the nucleus of a hydrogen atom. Physical properties: The physical properties of isotopes in a particular element vary from each other. This is because the physical properties of any isotope depend on the mass. The mass of each isotope of a single element varies from one another. Processes such as fractional distillation and diffusion are used to separate isotopes from one another. We make use of the fact that isotopes have different physical properties. Uses of Isotopes:  Carbon dating makes use of Carbon-14, an isotope of Carbon. This isotope of carbon is present in the atmosphere as radioactive carbon. The amount of carbon-14 obtained in fossils help palaeontologists to calculate the age of the fossils.  Uranium Isotopes are popular for its use in nuclear reactors. U-235 is used as a fuel in nuclear reactors.  Radioactive Isotopes are used for medicinal purposes. They are used for detection of tumours, blood clots, etc. Arsenic-74, An isotope of arsenic, is used for determining the presence of a tumour. Similarly, sodium-24 is used for the detection of blood clots.  Cobalt (cobalt-60) isotope of carbon is applied in cancer treatments.  Iodine (Iodine-131) isotope of carbon helps in the treatment of goitre.`

The number of electrons in orbit is equal to the number of protons in the nucleus (each proton has an an electrical charge of plus one, while each electron has the same charge only negative one). Since all atoms (of all element are electrically neutral), the number of electrons in orbit around the nucleus equals the number of protons in those nuclei, so the electrical charges balance each other. It is the way that these electrons orbit the nucleus (according to definite laws) that determines each element’s chemical properties. See a Periodic Table of the Elements.

            exp: `Explanation: Thomson atomic model was proposed by William Thomson in the year 1900. This model explained the description of an inner structure of the atom theoretically. It was strongly supported by Sir Joseph Thomson, who had discovered the electron earlier. During cathode ray tube experiment, a negatively charged particle was discovered by J.J. Thomson. This experiment took place in the year 1897. Cathode ray tube is a vacuum tube. The negative particle was called an electron. Thomson assumed that an electron is two thousand times lighter than a proton and believed that an atom is made up of thousands of electrons. In this atomic structure model, he considered atoms surrounded by a cloud having positive as well as negative charges. The demonstration of the ionization of air by X-ray was also done by him together with Rutherford. They were the first to demonstrate it. Thomson’s model of an atom is similar to a plum pudding. Postulates of Thomson’s atomic model: Postulate 1: An atom consists of a positively charged sphere with electrons embedded in it Postulate 2: An atom as a whole is electrically neutral because the negative and positive charges are equal in magnitude Thomson atomic model is compared to watermelon. Where he considered:  Watermelon seeds as negatively charged particles  The red part of the watermelon as positively charged Limitations of Thomson’s atomic model:  It failed to explain the stability of an atom because his model of atom failed to explain how a positive charge holds the negatively charged electrons in an atom. Therefore, This theory also failed to account for the position of the nucleus in an atom  Thomson’s model failed to explain the scattering of alpha particles by thin metal foils  No experimental evidence in its support.`

Note that Avogadro's number, on its own, is a dimensionless quantity. In chemistry and physics, Avogadro's number usually refers to a number of atoms, molecules, or ions, but it can be applied to any "particle." For example, 6.02 x 1023 elephants are the number of elephants in one mole of them! Atoms, molecules, and ions are much less massive than elephants, so there needed to be a large number to refer to a uniform quantity of them so that they could be compared relative to each other in chemical equations and reactions.`
