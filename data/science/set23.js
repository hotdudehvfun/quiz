        question:`#2. Osmosis is a process by which molecules of a solvent tend to pass through a semipermeable membrane from a less concentrated solution into a more concentrated one. Can you pick out the option among the following which does not belong to this process?`,
        options:
        [
'(a) The movement of water across a semipermeable membrane is affected by the amount of substances dissolved in it.',
'(b) Membranes are made of organic molecules such as proteins and lipids.',
'(c) Molecules soluble in organic solvents can easily pass through the membrane.',
            '(d) Plasma membranes contain chitin sugar in plants.',
        ],
        answer:`Answer: D`,
        exp:`Explanation: Osmosis is the diffusion of a solvent through a differentially permeable membrane. In biological systems, the solvent will usually be water. Osmosis will occur whenever the water concentrations are different on either side of a differentially permeable membrane. Osmosis can be defined as the movement of water molecules from a higher water concentration area to the area of less water concentration through a semipermeable membrane. In other words, it can be defined as the diffusion of water molecules through a semipermeable membrane. It is a special case of diffusion of water (High to low). For example, water in the roots of plants is transported through osmosis. Significance of Osmosis:  Osmosis influences the transport of nutrients and the release of metabolic waste products.  It is responsible for the absorption of water from the soil and conducting it to the upper parts of the plant through the xylem.  It stabilizes the internal environment of a living organism by maintaining the balance between water and intercellular fluid levels.  It maintains the turgidity of cells.  It is a process by which plants maintain their water content despite the constant water loss due to transpiration.  This process controls the cell to cell diffusion of water.  Osmosis induces cell turgor which regulates the movement of plants and plant parts.  Osmosis also controls the dehiscence of fruits and sporangia.  Higher osmotic pressure protects the plants against drought injury.`

        question:`#3. Cell is the structural and functional unit of life. The word cell is derived from the Latin word ‘cellula’ which means “a little room”. Can you name the scientist who coined the term cell?`,

        ],
        answer:`Answer: A`,
        exp:`Explanation: A cell is the structural and fundamental unit of life. The study of cells from its basic structure to the functions of every cell organelle is called Cell Biology. Robert Hooke was the first Biologist who discovered cells. All organisms are made up of cells. They may be made up of a single cell (unicellular), or many cells (multicellular). Mycoplasmas are the smallest known cells. Cells are the building blocks of all living beings. They provide structure to the body and convert the nutrients taken from the food into energy.Cells are complex, and their components perform various functions in an organism. They are of different shapes and sizes, pretty much like bricks of the buildings. Our body is made up of cells of different shapes and sizes.Cells are the lowest level of organisation in every life form. From organism to organism, the count of cells may vary. Humans have the number of cells compared to that of bacteria.Cells comprise several cell organelles that perform specialised functions to carry out life processes. Every organelle has a specific structure. The hereditary material of the organisms is also present in the cells. Robert Hooke discovered the cell in 1665. Robert Hooke observed a piece of bottle cork under a compound microscope and noticed minuscule structures that reminded him of small rooms. Consequently, he named these “rooms” as cells. However, his compound microscope had limited magnification, and hence, he could not see any details in the structure. Because of this limitation, Hooke concluded that these were non-living entities. Later Anton Van Leeuwenhoek observed cells under another compound microscope with higher magnification. This time, he had noted that the cells exhibited some form of movement (motility). As a result, Leeuwenhoek concluded that these microscopic entities were “alive.” Eventually, after a host of other observations, these entities were named as animalcules. In 1883, Robert Brown, a Scottish botanist, provided the very first insights into the cell structure. He was able to describe the nucleus present in the cells of orchids. Characteristics of Cells: Following are the various essential characteristics of cells:  Cells provide structure and support to the body of an organism.  The cell interior is organised into different individual organelles surrounded by a separate membrane.  The nucleus(major organelle) holds genetic information necessary for reproduction and cell growth.  Every cell has one nucleus and membrane-bound organelles in the cytoplasm.  Mitochondria, a double membrane-bound organelle is mainly responsible for the energy transactions vital for the survival of the cell.  Lysosomes digest unwanted materials in the cell.  Endoplasmic reticulum plays a significant role in the internal organisation of the cell by synthesising selective molecules and processing, directing and sorting them to their appropriate locations.`

All eukaryotic cells contain an endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In animal cells, the ER usually constitutes more than half of the membranous content of the cell. Differences in certain physical and functional characteristics distinguish the two types of ER, known as rough ER and smooth ER.`

        answer:`Answer: B`,
        exp:`Explanation: Lysosomes are an important cell organelle found within eukaryotic animal cells. Due to their peculiar function, they are also known as the “suicide bags” of the cell. The term was coined by Christian de Duve, a Belgian biologist, who discovered it and ultimately got a Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology in the year 1974. Lysosome Definition: “Lysosomes are sphere-shaped sacs filled with hydrolytic enzymes that have the capability to break down many types of biomolecules.” In other words, lysosomes are membranous organelles whose specific function is to breakdown cellular wastes and debris by engulfing it with hydrolytic enzymes. Lysosomes work as the waste discarding structures of the cell by processing undesirable materials and degrading them, both from the exterior of the cell and waste constituents inside the cell. But sometimes, the digestive enzymes may end up damaging the lysosomes themselves, and this can cause the cell to die. This is termed as autolysis, where “auto” means “self” and “lysis” means “the disintegration of the cell by the destruction of its cell membrane“. Hence, lysosomes are known as “Suicidal Bags” of the cell.`
