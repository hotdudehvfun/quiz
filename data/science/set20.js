            exp: `Explanation: The moon completes one rotation on its axis as it completes one revolution around the Earth. the the day of the appearance of the full disc of the moon is called full moon day, but the time period between two consecutive full moons is a little more than 29 days. In many calendars, this is the period of a month. The day on which the whole disc of the moon is visible is known as the full moon day. Thereafter, every night the size of the bright part of the moon appears to become thinner and thinner. On the fifteenth day the moon is not visible. This day is known as the new moon day. The next day, only a small portion of the moon appears in the sky. This is known as the crescent moon. Then again the moon grows larger every day. On the fifteenth day once again we get a full view of the moon. On July 21, 1969 the American astronaut Neil Armstrong landed on the moon for the first time followed by Edwin Aldrin.`

            answer: `Answer: B`,
            exp: `Explanation: stars are present in the sky during the daytime as well, but cannot be seen due to the glare of the sun. Due to the rotation of the earth from east to west, the stars appear to be rising from the east and setting at west. The distance between stars is expressed in light years. Hence, statement 2 is correct. It is the distance travelled by light in one year. The speed of light is about 300,000 km per second. Thus, the distance of the Sun from the Earth may be said to be about 8 light minutes.`

The eight planets in their order of distance from the Sun are: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. The planet mercury is nearest to the Sun. It is the smallest planet of our solar system. It can be observed just before sunrise or just after sunset, near the horizon. Mercury has no satellite of its own. Venus is earth’s nearest planetary neighbor. It is the brightest planet in the night sky. Sometimes Venus appears in the eastern sky before sunrise. Sometimes, it appears in the western sky just after sunset. Therefore it is often called a morning or an evening star. It has no satellite of its own. Rotation of Venus on its axis is somewhat unusual. It rotates from east to west while the Earth rotates from west to east. Jupiter is the largest planet of the solar system. It is so large that about 1300 earths can be placed inside this giant planet. However, the mass of Jupiter is about 318 times that of our Earth.Uranus also rotates from east to west. Uranus has highly tilted rotation axis. As a result, in its orbital motion it appears to roll on its side.`

            exp: `Explanation: There is a large gap in between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. This gap is occupied by a large number of small objects that revolve around the Sun. These are called asteroids.Comets revolve around the Sun in highly elliptical orbits. Their period of revolution round the Sun is usually very long. A comet appears generally as a bright head with a long tail. The length of the tail grows in size as it approaches the sun. The tail of a comet is always directed away from the sun. At night, when the sky is clear and the moon is not there, bright streaks of light in the sky can be seen. These are commonly known as shooting stars, although they are not stars. They are called meteors. A meteor is usually a small object that occasionally enters the earth’s atmosphere. At that time, it has a very high speed. The friction due to the atmosphere heats it up. It glows and evaporates quickly. That is why, the bright steak lasts for a very short time.`

They also seep into the ground to pollute groundwater. Excessive quantities of chemicals which get washed from the fields, act as nutrients for algae to flourish. Once these algae die, they serve as food for decomposers like bacteria. A lot of oxygen in the water body gets used up. This results in a decrease in the oxygen level which may kill aquatic organisms. Hot water can also be a pollutant. This is usually water from power plants and industries. It is released into the rivers. It raises the temperature of the waterbody, adversely affecting the animals and plants thriving in it.`
