        exp:`Answer: B
        Explanation: The inner lining of the stomach secretes mucus,
        hydrochloric acid and digestive juices. Mucus protects the lining of
        the stomach. The hydrochloric acid kills many bacteria that enter
        along with the food and makes the medium in the stomach acidic and
        helps the digestive juices to act. Digestive juices break down the
        proteins into simpler substances
        The digested food can now pass into the blood vessels through the
        wall of the small intestine. This process is called absorption.
        The large intestine absorbs water and some salts from the
        undigested food material.
        The liver is the largest gland in the body. It secretes bile juice that
        is stored in a sac called the gallbladder. Bile plays an important role
        in the digestion of fats.`

        answer:`Answer: D`,
        exp:`Answer: D
        Explanation: It is the microscopic unicellular organism found in pond
        water which keeps changing its shape and position constantly. It has
        a cell membrane, a rounded, dense nucleus and many small bubblelike vacuoles in its cytoplasm.
        The amoeba is a tiny, one-celled organism. You need a microscope to
        see most amoebas - the largest are only about 1 mm across. Amoebas
        live in fresh water (like puddle and ponds), in salt water, in wet soil,
        and in animals (including people). There are many different types of
        amoebas. The name amoeba comes from the Greek word amoibe,
        which means change. (Amoeba is sometimes spelled ameba.)
        1. Cell membrane - the thin layer of protein and fat that surrounds
        the amoeba; it allows some substances to pass into the cell, and
        blocks other substances.
        2. Contractile vacuole - a cavity within the amoeba that excretes
        excess water and waste; the waste is brought to the cell membrane
        and is then eliminated from the amoeba.
        3. Cytoplasm (ectoplasm and endoplasm) - a jelly-like material that
        fills most of the cell; the organelles (like the nucleus) are
        surrounded by cytoplasm.
        4. Food vacuole - a cavity within the amoeba in which food is
        digested (broken down in order to be absorbed by the amoeba).
        5. Nucleus - the major organelle of the amoeba, located centrally; it
        controls reproduction (it contains the chromosomes) and many other
        important functions (including eating and growth).
        6. Pseudopods - temporary “feet” that the amoeba uses to move
        around and to engulf food.
        An amoeba consists of a single blobby cell surrounded by a porous
        cell membrane. The amoeba “breathes” using this membrane - oxygen
        gas from the water passes in to the amoeba through the cell
        membrane and carbon dioxide gas leaves through it. A complex, jellylike series of folded membranes called cytoplasm fills most of the
        cell. A large, disk-shaped nucleus within the amoeba controls the
        growth and reproduction of the amoeba.`

        answer:`Answer: B`,
        exp:`Answer: B
        Explanation: The liver is an abdominal glandular organ in
        the digestive system. It is located in the right upper quadrant of
        the abdomen, under the diaphragm and on top of the stomach. The
        liver is a vital organ that supports nearly every other organ to some
        capacity. The liver is the body's second-largest organ (skin is the
        largest organ.
        Function: "The liver has a complex role in the function of the body,"
        said Jordan Knowlton, an advanced registered nurse practitioner at
        the University of Florida Health Shands Hospital.
        "Detoxification, metabolism (including regulation of glycogen
        storage), hormone regulation, protein synthesis, digestion, and
        decomposition of red blood cells, to name a few."
         Production of bile, which helps carry away waste and break
        down fats in the small intestine during digestion.
         Production of certain proteins for blood plasma.
         Production of cholesterol and special proteins to help carry
        fats through the body
         Conversion of excess glucose into glycogen for storage
        (glycogen can later be converted back to glucose for energy)
        and to balance and make glucose as needed
         Regulation of blood levels of amino acids, which form the
        building blocks of proteins
         Processing of hemoglobin for use of its iron content (the liver
        stores iron)
         Conversion of poisonous ammonia to urea (urea is an end
        product of protein metabolism and is excreted in the urine)
         Clearing the blood of drugs and other poisonous substances
         Regulating blood clotting
         Resisting infections by making immune factors and removing
        bacteria from the bloodstream
         Clearance of bilirubin, also from red blood cells. If there is an
        accumulation of bilirubin, the skin and eyes turn yellow.`

        assertions:
        1. Digestive juices convert simple substances of food into complex
        ones, which is helpful in digestion.
        2. The inner walls of the stomach, the small intestine, and the

        question:`5. Which of the following are examples of a symbiotic
        relationship?
        1. Algae and fungus
        2. Algae and bacteria
        3. Fungus and bacteria
        4. Plants and bacteria

            'A. 1 and 3 only',
'B. 1, 2 and 3 only',
'C. 1 and 4 only',
'D. 2, 3 and 4 only'

        ],
        answer:`Answer: C`,
        exp:`Answer: C
        Explanation: There is a symbiotic relationship between algae and
        fungus. For example, in organisms called lichens, a chlorophyllcontaining partner, which is an alga, and a fungus live together. The
        fungus provides shelter, water and minerals to the alga and, in
        return, the alga prepares and provides food to the fungus.
        The bacterium called Rhizobium can take atmospheric nitrogen and
        convert it into a usable form. But Rhizobium cannot make its own
        food. So, it often lives in the roots of gram, peas, moong, beans and
        other legumes and provides them with nitrogen. In return, the plants
        provide food and shelter to the bacteria. They, thus, have a
        symbiotic relationship. (i.e., between plants and bacteria).`

        question:`6. Consider the following statements :
        1. Some organisms live together and share both shelter and
        nutrients. This relationship is called symbiosis.
        2. Nutrition in which organisms take in nutrients from dead and
        decaying matter is called saprotrophic nutrition.

            'D. Neither 1 nor 2',
        ],
        answer:`Answer: C`,
        exp:`Answer: C
        Explanation: Some organisms live together and share both shelter
        and nutrients. This relationship is called symbiosis. For example,
        certain fungi live inside the roots of plants. The plants provide
        nutrients to the fungus and, in return, the fungus provides water and
        certain nutrients. For example: lichens.
        The mode of nutrition in which organisms take in nutrients from
        dead and decaying matter is called saprotrophic nutrition. Such
        organisms with saprotrophic mode of nutrition are called
        saprotrophs. For example fungi, that grow on pickles, leather,
        clothes and other articles that had been left out in hot and humid
        weather for a long time, is a saprotroph. Note that during the rainy
        season such fungal growth may spoil a lot of household things.

            'D. Neither 1 nor 2'
        ],
        answer:`Answer: B`,
        exp:`Answer: B
        Explanation: There are some plants which do not have chlorophyll.
        They cannot synthesise food. Like humans and animals such plants
        depend on the food produced by other plants. They use the
        heterotrophic mode of nutrition. For example: Cuscuta (Amarbel).
        Plants cannot absorb nitrogen in gaseous form. Soil has certain
        bacteria that convert gaseous nitrogen into a usable form and
        release it into the soil. This is absorbed by the plants along with
        water.

        exp:`Answer: B
        Explanation: Both carbohydrate and oxygen are formed in the
        process of photosynthesis.Besides leaves, photosynthesis also takes
        place in other green parts of the plant — in green stems and green
        branches. Desert plants have scales or spine-like leaves to
        reduce loss of water by transpiration. These plants have green
        stems which carry out photosynthesis.`

        ],
        answer:`Answer: D`,
        exp:`Answer: D
        Explanation: Leaves have a green pigment called chlorophyll. It
        helps leaves to capture the energy of sunlight. This energy is used
        to synthesise (prepare) food from carbon dioxide and water. Since
        the synthesis of food occurs in the presence of sunlight, it is called
        photosynthesis (Photo: light; synthesis: to prepare). So, chlorophyll,
        sunlight, carbon dioxide and water are necessary to carry out the
        process of photosynthesis.
        What is photosynthesis?
        Photosynthesis is the process in which light energy is converted to
        chemical energy in the form of sugars. In a process driven by light
        energy, glucose molecules (or other sugars) are constructed from
        water and carbon dioxide, and oxygen is released as a byproduct.
        The glucose molecules provide organisms with two crucial resources:
        energy and fixed—organic—carbon.`

        question:`10. Which of the followings is/are called 'Food Factories of
        Plants'?
        1. Leaf
        2. Stem
        3. Root

            'D. 3 and 4 only'
        ],
        answer:`Answer: A`,
        exp:`Answer: A
        Explanation: Leaves are the food factories of plants. Water and
        minerals present in the soil are absorbed by the roots and
        transported to the leaves. Therefore, all the raw materials must
        reach the leaf.
        A plant needs sunlight, carbon dioxide, minerals and water to make
        food by photosynthesis. A green substance in plants called
        chlorophyll traps the energy from the sun needed to make food.
        Chlorophyll is mostly found in leaves, inside plastids. Which are
        inside the leaf cells. The leaf can be thought as food factory. Leaves
        of plants vary in shape and size, but they are always the plant organ
        best suited to capture solar energy. Once the food is made in the
        leaf, it is transported to the other parts of the plant such as steams
        and roots.`
