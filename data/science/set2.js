        Explanation: Wool is obtained from the fleece (hair) of sheep or
        yak. Silk fibres come from cocoons of the silk moth. Wool-yielding
        animals; for example (sheep, goat and yak) bear hair on their body.

        answer:`Answer: D`,
        exp:`Answer: D
        Explanation: Angora wool or Angora fiber refers to the downy coat
        produced by the Angora rabbit. While their names are similar,
        Angora fiber is distinct from mohair, which comes from the Angora
        goat. Angora is known for its softness, low micron count (i.e. thin
        fibers), and what knitters refer to as a halo (fluffiness). It is also
        known for its silky texture.Angora rabbits produce coats in a variety
        of colors, from white to black. Good quality angora fiber is around
        12-16 microns in diameter, and can cost around 10 - 16 dollars per
        ounce. It felts very easily, even on the animal itself if the animal is
        not groomed frequently.The fiber is normally blended with wool to
        give the yarn elasticity, as angora fiber is not naturally elastic. The
        blend decreases the softness and halo as well as the price of the
        finished object.
        The name Pashmina has been derived from a Persian word “Pashm”
        meaning a weavable fiber precisely wool. The wool used for making
        Pashmina comes from a special breed of Kashmiri goat found in the
        high altitude regions of the Himalayas. The 15th century ruler of
        Kashmir, Zayn-ul-Abidin, is said to be the founder of the wool
        industry in Kashmir. However, the history of these shawls can be
        traced back to the 3rd century BC. Pashmina has been an integral
        part of the traditional wear for centuries. In the earlier times, it
        was only worn by kings and queens and thus denoted royalty. The art
        of weaving Pashmina has been passed on as a legacy from generations
        to generations in the state of Kashmir. A good Pashmina shawl
        requires an expert hand for spinning, weaving and creating
        embroidery.

        Explanation: The rearing of silkworms for obtaining silk is called
        sericulture.The female silk moth lays hundreds of eggs, from which
        hatch larvae which are called caterpillars or silkworms. They grow in
        size and when the caterpillar is ready to enter the next stage of its
        life history called pupa, it first weaves a net to hold itself. Then it
        swings its head from side to side in the form of the figure of eight
        (8). During these movements of the head, the caterpillar secretes
        fibre made of a protein which hardens on exposure to air and
        becomes silk fibre.

        Explanation: The silk fibre is as strong as steel wire.There is a
        variety of silk moths which look very different from one another and
        the silk yarn they yield is different in texture (coarse, smooth,
        shiny, etc.). Thus, tussar silk, muga silk, kosa silk, etc., are obtained
        from cocoons spun by different types of moths. The most common
        silk moth is the mulberry silk moth.

        ],
        answer:`Answer: D`,
        exp:`Answer: D
        Explanation: Heat Transfer: The movement of heat from a warmer
        object to a colder one - when two substances at different
        temperatures are mixed together, heat flows from the warmer body
        to the cooler body until they reach the same temperature (Zeroth
        Law of Thermodynamics - Thermal Equilibrium). Part of the heat lost
        by the warmer body is transferred t the cooler body and part is lost
        to the surrounding object or the air.
        A. Convection is the process of heat transfer by the bulk movement
        of molecules within fluids such as gases and liquids. The initial heat
        transfer between the object and the fluid takes place through
        conduction, but the bulk heat transfer happens due to the motion of
        the fluid.
         Convection is the process of heat transfer in fluids by the
        actual motion of matter.
         It happens in liquids and gases.
         It may be natural or forced.
         It involves a bulk transfer of portions of the fluid.
        How is Heat Transferred through Convection?
        When a fluid is heated from below, thermal expansion takes place.
        The lower layers of the fluid, which are hotter, become less dense.
        We know that colder fluid is denser. Due to buoyancy, the less
        dense, hotter part of the fluid rises up. And the colder, denser fluid
        replaces it. This process is repeated when this part also gets heated
        and rises up to be replaced by the colder upper layer. This is how
        the heat is transferred through convection.
        Types of Convection: There are two types of convection, and they
        are:
        1. Natural convection
        2. Forced convection
        1. Natural convection: When convection takes place due to buoyant
        force as there is a difference in densities caused by the difference
        in temperatures it is known as natural convection.Examples of
        natural convection are oceanic winds.
        2. Forced convection: When external sources such as fans and
        pumps are used for creating induced convection, it is known as
        forced convection.Examples of forced convection are using water
        heaters or geysers for instant heating of water and using a fan on a
        hot summer day.
        B. Conduction is the transfer of energy in the form of heat or
        electricity from one atom to another within an object by direct
        contact. Conduction occurs in solids, liquids, and gases. However,
        solids transfer energy most efficiently since the molecules in solids
        are most tightly packed, and the molecules are closer together, as
        shown in this figure. For liquids and gases, the density of the
        particles are generally lower than those of solids and the particles
        are farther apart, so the energy transfer is less efficient.
        There are two main types of conduction:
        1. Conduction of heat occurs when molecules increase in
        temperature; they vibrate, and this vibration and movement passes
        the heat energy to the surrounding molecules. Some examples of
        conduction of heat are accidentally touching a hot pot, or when a
        heating pad is applied to you directly and warms your muscles.
        2. Conduction of electricity occurs due to the movement of
        electrically charged particles through a medium. This movement can
        result in an electric current, which may be carried by electrons or
        ions. An example of electrical conduction is when you accidentally
        get electrocuted when you touch a live wire because your body
        contains water, which is a conductor of electricity. Another example
        is when electricity passes through wires, which are conductors, so
        we can watch TV or use a computer.`

        ],
        answer:`Answer: A`,
        exp:`Answer: A
        Explanation: During the day, the land gets heated faster than the
        water. The air over the land becomes hotter and rises up. The cooler
        air from the sea rushes in towards the land to take its place. The
        warm air from the land moves towards the sea to complete the cycle.
        The air from the sea is called the sea breeze. To receive the cooler
        sea breeze, the windows of the houses in coastal areas are made to
        face the sea. At night it is exactly the reverse. The water cools
        down more slowly than the land. So, the cool air from the land moves
        towards the sea. This is called the land breeze. Dark surfaces
        absorb more heat and, therefore, we feel comfortable with dark
        coloured clothes in the winter. Light coloured clothes reflect most
        of the heat that falls on them and, therefore, we feel more
        comfortable wearing them in the summer.
